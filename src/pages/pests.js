<h2>Pests</h2>
<p>	 In layman terms, a pest is any undesirable
organism that disturbs normal human life.
•	 Scientific definition of a pest is any destructive
organism, which damages cultivated plants,
forests, stored products, domestic products
etc., including aesthetic qualities.
•	 All crops are attacked or affected by a
variety of pests that include weeds, insects,
nematodes, rodents, birds, diseases caused
by fungi, bacteria, viruses, etc.
•	 Despite using pesticides worth more than
US$ 32 billion for crop protection worldwide,
annually we incur crop losses to the tune of
33 to 35 per cent. </p>

<h4>INSECTS, MITES, NEMATODES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT</h4>
<p>This chapter deals mainly with the damage caused by insects, mites and nematodes and their
effective management.</p>

<h4>Insects</h4>
<p>•	 These include phytophagous insects that eat
leaves, stems, flowers, fruits and roots of
plants and those that also serve as vectors
that carry disease causing bacteria, viruses
and fungi.
•	 They may be variously classified into
taxonomic orders, based on venation of
wings, mouth parts, feeding behaviour, types
of injury they cause, etc.</p>

<h5>Classification based on taxonomic orders</h5>
<h6>Orthoptera</h6>
<p>Orthoptera is an order of insects that
comprises of grasshoppers, locusts and
crickets.
•	 The order is subdivided into two suborders:
Chelicera – grasshoppers, locusts and
close relatives; and Ensifera – crickets and
close relatives.</p>

<h6>Hemiptera</h6>
<p>The Hemiptera or true bugs are an order of
insects comprising some 50,000 to 80,000
species of groups such as the whiteflies,
cicadas, aphids, mealy bugs, scales, plant
hoppers, leaf hoppers, and shield bugs.
•	 They range in size from 1 mm to 15 cm, and
share a common arrangement of sucking
mouthparts</p>

<h6>Lepidoptera</h6>
<p>•	 Lepidoptera is an order of insects that
includes butterflies and moths.
•	 About 180,000 species of the Lepidoptera
are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, which is 10 per cent of the total
described species of living organisms.
•	 It is one of the most widespread and widely
recognizable insect orders in the world.</p>

<h6>Diptera</h6>
<p>•	 Diptera is an order that includes the twowinged or so-called true flies e.g. fruit flies,
shoot flies, leaf miners, etc.
•	 It numbers more than 125,000 species that
are relatively small, with soft bodies.
•	 The mouthparts of flies are of the sucking
type and many flies are of great economic
importance</p>

<h6>Thysanoptera</h6>
<p>•	 Thrips are minute, slender insects with
fringed wings and unique asymmetrical
mouthparts.
•	 Thrips species feed mostly on plants by
puncturing and sucking up the contents,
although a few are predators.
•	 Approximately 6,000 species have been
described.</p>

<h6>Coleoptera</h6>
<p>•	 Beetles and weevils are a group of insects
that form the order Coleoptera, in the
superorder Endopterygota.
•	 Their front pair of wings is hardened into
wing-cases (elytra), distinguishing them from
most other insects.
•	 This is the largest of all insect orders.</p>

<h5>Classification based on  the mouth parts/feeding behavior/type of injury</h5>
<p>•	 Insects cause injury to almost all parts of
plants either directly or indirectly to secure
food.
•	 Mouthparts differ from insect to insect
and the damage that they cause provides
useful information for identification and
classification of the pest.
•	 Being able to identify the type of damage
caused by the various types of mouthparts
also helps to differentiate insect damage from
mite damage and also to determine how to
control the pest.
•	 There are two main categories of mouthparts Biting and Chewing mouthparts and Nonchewing mouthparts.</p>

<h5>I. BITING AND CHEWING MOUTHPARTS</h5>
<p>Biting and Chewing mouthparts, often referred to as mandibulate mouthparts, are the most primitive
type. </p>

<h5>Chewing insects</h5>
<p>•	 These insects chew, grind and swallow
external part of the plant (leaves, stems,
flowers, fruits, etc.) with the help of strong,
well-developed mandibles.
•	 These insects are phytophagous and belong
to the orders Orthoptera (grasshoppers),
Coleoptera (beetles), and Lepidoptera
(caterpillars).
•	 Some of these insects can eat to the extent
of skeletonizing the leaves or even denuding
the plants. e.g., Caterpillars, Ash weevil,
Diamond back moth, etc.</p>

<h5>Boring insects</h5>
<p>•	 The insect larvae that feed by getting inside
the plant tissue (stems, shoots, roots, fruits,
pods, etc.) are called borers.
•	 They make galleries as they feed upon the
internal tissues, leave frass in them and make
the plant weak.
•	 Borers belong to insect orders Coleoptera,
Lepidoptera and Diptera.
•	 Borers of fruits are called worms (Lepidoptera
– Cotton bollworms, Brinjal shoot & fruit
borer, etc.).
•	 Borers of seeds and grains are called weevils
(Coleoptera – Rice weevil, Ash weevil,
Coconut Rhinoceros beetle, etc.).
•	 Borers of leaves are called leaf miners
(Diptera – Leaf miners of Tomato, Bean,
Cucurbits, etc.).</p>

<h5>Damage</h5>
<p>•	 Taking a closer look at the damage gives us
a clue as to which kind of insect or mite has
caused the damage.
•	 The signs of damage that an insect or mite
with piercing-sucking mouthparts has caused
looks very different from the feeding pattern
of an insect with chewing mouthparts.
•	 Chewing mouthparts result in parts of the
plant being (leaves, stems, flowers, fruits,
roots and seeds) chewed or torn off, which
can be easily identified by
o Holes or notches on leaves
o Surface feeder window
o Stem chewed at base
o Stem/shoot bored
o Seed consumed
o Fruit tunneled
o Root damaged
o Surface of tuber chewed or tunneled</p>

<h5>Root eating subterranean insects</h5>
<p>•	 Insects found in soil feed on the roots of
plants and trees by chewing or boring or
sucking the sap and forming galls.
•	 Most soil inhabiting insects damage the
crops in their larval stage and only a few
spend their life cycle entirely in the soil (wire
worms, cut worms, etc.).
•	 Some insects live through several stages in
the soil as in white grub of Finger millet and
root grubs of Sugarcane, Arecanut, etc.
•	 Though the damage caused to roots may
vary depending on the species and crops
affected, generally the affected plants show
stunting, discoloration, withering and death
of the plants</p>

<h5>Gall Producers</h5>
<p>•	 Gall-inducing insects cause external
outgrowth or tumors of various shapes and
sizes called galls.
•	 The term gall fly is also used to describe these
species, although most are not true flies.
•	 These insects belong to the order Diptera
(gall midges) or Hymenoptera (gall wasps).
•	 Galls are formed by insect/mite feeding or
egg-laying activity.
•	 The adults initiate formation of galls
by oviposition and the larvae continue
development of galls.
•	 Either mechanical damage or salivary
secretions of insects and/or mites causes
increased production of normal plant growth
hormones, leading to localized increase in
cell size and/or cell number.
•	 Although the gall is entirely a plant tissue,
the insects in some unknown manner control
and direct the shape and size.
•	 The outcome is an abnormal plant structure
called a gall.
•	 Due to the formation of galls, the growth of
the plant may be impaired and yield may be
adversely affected.</p>

<h5>Injury by nest making</h5>
<p>•	 Some insects remove parts of the plants for
the construction of their nests though they
do not feed on them.
•	 In case of the red ant, the nest is constructed
on the tree itself by webbing together a few
leaves of Mango, Guava, Pomegranate, etc.</p>

<h5>II NON-CHEWING MOUTHPARTS</h5>
<p>Non-chewing mouthparts are modifications
of mandibulate mouthparts and are used for ‘sucking’ up liquids or rasping across the
surface of the leaf.</p>

<h5>Piercing and sucking mouthparts</h5>
<p>•	 Piercing and sucking mouthparts are
modification of the mandibles and maxillae,
which are elongated and modified to form
a proboscis for piercing plant tissues.
•	 The insect pierces the surface of the plant
and sucks out the sap from within.
•	 This action also removes the green
chlorophyll from the plant.</p>
<p>•	 While sucking, some insects inject saliva,
excrete honey dew, etc.
•	 Examples of insects with piercing & sucking
mouthparts include, aphids, white flies,
leafhoppers, mealy bugs, scales and fleas
(Hemiptera).</p>

<h5>Rasping and sucking mouthparts</h5>
<p>•	 Rasping and sucking occurs when the insect
or mite scrapes off the leaf surface and sucks
up the fluids from the top layer of cells.
•	 This causes the leaf to turn to a silvery color.
•	 Examples of pests with rasping & sucking
mouthparts include thrips (Thysanoptera)
and mites. </p>
<p>•	 The damage caused by thrips and mites
looks very similar.
•	 The dipteran flies shred the surface tissue to
ingest the sap and bore tunnels (leaf miners
and fruit flies).</p>

<h5>Damage</h5>
<p>•	 Insects with piercing & sucking mouthparts
like aphids pierce parts of their host plant,
causing the affected area to become brown
or resulting in wilt or a tumor-like growth.
•	 Pests with rasping & sucking mouthparts
like thrips and mites remove the top layer of
cells and suck out the cell contents, causing
the leaf to look silvery or bronze in color. </p>
<p>•	 In both the above types no part of the plant
is missing.
•	 Dipteran flies cause ragged wounds, mining
on the surface of the leaves, stem, tunnel on
the roots, bulbs, etc.
•	 Most importantly these insects also
transmit viruses.</p>

<h5>Dissemination of plant diseases by insects</h5>
<p>•	 Insects are responsible for spreading several
plant diseases caused by bacteria, fungi and
viruses.
•	 While bacteria and fungi have alternative
methods of dispersal, majority of plant
viruses are dependent on insect vectors for
their dissemination.
•	 The insects act as mechanical carriers of the
pathogens in or outside their body to pass them on to the plants by injection, contact or
through contaminated ovipositor during egg
laying.
•	 Most of the insect vectors belong to the
order Hemiptera (Aphids, White flies, Leaf
hoppers and Mealy bugs).
•	 A few belong to Thysanoptera (Thrips),
Coleoptera (Beetles) and Orthoptera (Grass
hoppers).</p>

<h5>Mites</h5>
<p>•	 Mites belong to the order Acarina of the
class Arachnida.
•	 The phytophagous mites belong mainly to
the families Tetranychidae, Eriophyidae,
Tarsonemidae and Tenupalpidae.
•	 Mouth parts of mites are adapted for biting,
piercing and sucking.</p>

<h5>Diagnostic features of Tetranychidae and Eriophyidae</h5>
<p>Tetranychidae | Eriophyidae
Tiny and oval in shape.| Elongate and vermiform in shape.
Body unsegmented and not divided into
cephalothorax and abdomen.|
Body distinctly divided into cephalothorax and
abdomen.
Possess 4 pairs of legs in the nymphal and
adult stages and 3 pairs in the larvae.|
Possess only 2 pairs of legs situated near the
anterior end of the body, both in nymphal and
adult stages.</p>

<h5>Tetranychids</h5>
<p>•	 Tetranychids penetrate the plant tissue with
sharp stylets and remove the cell contents.
•	 The chloroplasts disappear and the small
amount of remaining cellular material
coagulates to form an amber colored mass.
•	 In the palisade layer, only the penetrated cells
are damaged and continued feeding leads to
irregular spots; transpiration rate accelerates,
which finally leads to drying and dropping of
leaves.
•	 The mite infestation inhibits photosynthesis
and changes the composition of leaf pigments
leading to a complex of symptoms like
o yellowing, bronzing, distortion, curling,
crinkling, defoliation of leaves
o retardation in growth.
o premature dropping of flowers, reduction
in size, quality and quantity of produce.</p>

<h5>Eriophyids</h5>
<p>•	 Eriophyids in general, cause no serious
mechanical damage to plant tissue by their
feeding.
•	 Salivary growth regulators, when injected in
to plants cause discolouration and growth
modifications like galls, erinea blisters, rust,
brooming, leaf edge rolling, etc.
•	 The coconut mite Aceria guerreronis is
an eriophyid mite, can destroy up to 90% of
Coconut production.
•	 It infests immature nuts and feeds on the
portion of the nut covered by the perianth.</p>

<h5>Tarsonemids</h5>
<p>•	 Tarsonemids penetrate thin–walled and
highly succulent tissues but are incapable of
penetrating thick walled lignified tissues.
•	 Occasionally toxins are injected, which
presumably cause alterations in normal
tissues.</p>

<h5>Predatory Mites</h5>
<p>•	 Predatory mites are the efficient natural
enemies of phytophagous mites.
•	 Mites of the family Phytoseiidae have
been recognized as potential predators of
phytophagous mites.
•	 Phytoseiidae, Stigmaeidae, Anastidae,
Cheyletidae and Erythradidae are the
important predatory mite groups.
•	 The Phytoseiid mites feed specially on mites
of the families Tetranychidae, Eryophidae,
Tarsoemidae and Tenupalpidae.
•	 The miscellaneous groups include Bdellidae,
Tarsonemidae and Tydeidae .</p>

<h5>Mites known to transmit viral diseases</h5>
<p>•	 Aceria tulipae is a vector of Wheat streak
mosaic virus.
•	 Aceria cajani transmits pigeon pea sterility
mosaic virus.</p>

<h4>Nematodes</h4>
<p>•	 A number of genera and species of nematodes
are known to cause significant damage to a
great range of hosts, including foliage plants,
agronomic and vegetable crops, fruit and
nut trees, plantation crops, and commercial
crops.
•	 Some of the most damaging nematodes are:
o	 Root knot (Meloidogyne spp.)
o	 Cyst (Heterodera and Globodera spp.)
o	 Root lesion (Pratylenchus spp.)
o	 Spiral (Helicotylenchus spp.)
o	 Bulb and stem (Ditylenchus dipsaci)
o	 Reniform (Rotylenchulus reniformis)
o	 Dagger (Xiphinema spp.)
o	 Bud and leaf (Aphelenchoides spp.)</p>

<h5>Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 Nematodes are simple, multi-cellular animals
typically containing 1,000 cells or less.
•	 They are bilaterally symmetrical, softbodied, non-segmented and worm-like in
appearance but are taxonomically distinct from earthworms, wireworms or flatworms.
•	 The basic body plan of a nematode is a “tube
within a tube.”
•	 Most nematodes are not pathogens but
rather saprophytes.
•	 Some, however, are serious human, animal,
and plant pathogens.
•	 Those that attack animals or humans do not
attack plants and vice versa.
•	 Most nematode species that attack plants
are microscopic and attack the roots, stem,
foliage, and flowers of plants.
•	 Plant-parasitic nematodes are typically
microscopic, transparent, and vermiform;
exceptions are the females of some genera,
which become swollen and sac-like.
•	 All plant parasitic nematodes have piercing
mouthparts called stylets and the presence
of a stylet is the key diagnostic sign
differentiating plant parasitic nematodes
from all other types of nematodes.</p>

<h5>Signs and Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Typical root symptoms indicating nematode
attack are root knots or galls, root lesions,
excessive root branching, injured root tips,
and stunted root systems.
•	 Symptoms on the above-ground plant parts
are stunted growth, frequently chlorotic,
wilting even with ample soil moisture, fewer
and smaller leaves.
•	 Root knot nematodes usually are detected
first in localized areas within a field, nursery
planting, or home garden, etc.
•	 Affected field spots most often are circular to
oval in shape and vary from a few feet across
to several acres.
•	 The damage is most conspicuous in the
center of an infested area and diminishes
toward the edges. Occasionally, entire fields
are involved.
•	 Crop yields can be reduced up to 90% or more,
depending on the nematode population and
biotic and abiotic factors.
•	 Presence of root-knot nematodes cannot be
diagnosed by above-ground symptoms alone,
since factors such as poor drainage, low soil
fertility, and other disease-causing organisms
produce similar symptoms.
•	 Bulb and stem nematodes produce swellings
on stem and shortened internodes.
•	 Bud and leaf nematodes distort and kill bud
and leaf tissue.</p>

<h5>Dissemination</h5>
<p>•	 Parasitic nematodes are readily spread by any
physical means that can move soil particles
like equipment, tools, shoes, birds, insects,
dust, wind and water. </p>

<h5>Life cycle</h5>
<p>•	 The life cycle of a typical plant-parasitic
nematode is simple and direct.
•	 An egg laid by the female develops into a
first stage juvenile, which usually undergoes
a first moult within the egg shell and hatches
as a second-stage juvenile.
•	 After hatching, the juvenile develops through
two more stages; each completed by a moult,
and becomes an adult after the fourth moult.
•	 The time required to complete the life cycle
varies considerably, from a week to several
months, depending on the genus and on
temperature and moisture.
•	 Plant parasitic nematodes feed and reproduce
on living plants and are capable of active
migration in the rhizosphere, on aerial plant
parts, and/or inside the plant.
•	 Unlike free-living nematodes that are
numerous in all soils, plant parasitic
nematodes must feed on a plant host in
order to complete their life cycle. •	 Root-knot nematodes are soil-borne and feed
on roots.
•	 Eggs hatch into juveniles that infect plant
roots and take nutrients from the plant as
they mature, causing characteristic knots or
swellings.
•	 Those that enter the root and develop
into females are sedentary, become much
enlarged, and lay hundreds of eggs in a sac
on the root surface.
•	 In moist soils above 270
C, root-knot
nematodes can go from egg to adult in about
25 days.</p>

<h5> Environmental Conditions</h5>
<p>•	 Nematodes are most active in warm weather
in moist, but well aerated, sandy soils in the
presence of host plants.
•	 They are most abundant in the upper foot of
soils, but will follow roots several feet deep.</p>
