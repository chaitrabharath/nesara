<h2>INTEGRATED INSECT AND DISEASE
MANAGEMENT (IIDM)</h2>
<p> IIDM is a sustainable approach to managing
pests by combining biological, cultural,
physical and chemical tools in a way
that minimizes economic, health, and
environmental risks.
The major components of IPDM are:
•	 Cultural practices
•	 Mechanical practices
•	 Biological methods
•	 Genetic resistance
•	 Regulatory methods, and
•	 Chemical methods</p>

<h3>CULTURAL PRACTICES</h3>
<p>•	 Cultural methods of pest control consist of
regular field operations carried out in a way
to either destroy the pests or prevent them
from causing economic loss.
•	 The various cultural practices that contribute
to IPDM are:
o	 Rendering the land for nurseries or
main fields free from pest infestation by
removing plant debris, trimming of bunds,
treating soil, etc.
o	 Deep summer ploughing to kill various
stages of pests.
o	 Providing adequate drainage in the field.
o	 Soil testing for balanced nutrient
management to avoid deficiencies.
o	 Selection of clean and certified seeds
and treating seeds with fungicide or
biopesticides before sowing for controlling
seed-borne diseases.
o	 Selection of relatively pest resistant/
tolerant varieties, which play a significant
role in pest suppression.
o	 Scheduling the time of sowing and
harvesting to escape peak season of pest
attack.
o	 Crop rotation with non-host crops to
reduce incidence of soil-borne diseases.
o	 Adopting adequate plant spacing and row
orientation to facilitate easy movement of
air, which helps in reducing build up of
pest population and infection.
o	 Proper water management (alternate
wetting and drying to avoid water
stagnation) to avoid high moisture in soil
for prolonged periods, which is conducive
for development of pests, especially those
causing soil-borne diseases.
o	 Proper weed management is a must since
most weeds besides competing with the
crop for space, light and nutrients, also
harbour many pests.
o	 Setting up colored sticky traps and
pheromone traps to trap insects.
o	 Growing trap crops on the borders to
trap and eliminate pests either by using
pesticides or its natural enemies. e.g.,
Mustard in Cabbage and Cauliflower fields.
o	 Mixed cropping or multiple cropping is to
be followed wherever possible.
o	 All crops are not preferred by a pest species
and certain crops also act as repellents,
thus keeping the pest species away from
preferred crops resulting in reduction of
pest incidence.
o	 Harvesting as close to ground level as
possible.
o	 This is because certain developmental
stages of insect pests/diseases remain
on the plant parts, which act as primary
inoculum for the next crop season. Hence,
harvesting crops at ground level will lessen
the incidence of pests in the next season.
o	Treat seedlings before planting, by
spraying/dipping in fungicide/biopesticide
solutions to protect the plants from soilborne diseases.
o	 While pruning fruit trees, remove
crowded/dead/broken/diseased branches
and destroy them.
o	 Do not pile them in the orchards since it
acts as a source of pest infestation.
o	 Large pruning wounds should be covered
with Bordeaux paste/paint to protect the
plants from pest/disease attack.
o	 For excellent fruit set, pollinizer cultivars
should be planted in required proportion
in the orchards.
o	 Keeping Beehives or placing flower
bouquets of pollinizer cultivars facilitates
better pollination and subsequent fruit set.
</p>

<h3>Use of Disease-free propagating materials
</h3>
<p>Propagating materials such as seeds, tubers,
bulbs, nursery seedlings, etc., may carry
pathogens and become a source of infection</p>
<p>Certified propagating materials should be
used or they should be treated with biocontrol agents or suitable pesticides before
sowing/planting to avoid disease incidence.</p>

<h3>Seed rate and plant population
</h3>
<p>•	 The seed rate and plant population per acre
or hectare play an important role in disease
management.
•	 It is established that if seed rate/plant
population exceeds the recommended rate
then there are chances of disease incidence
due to lack of aeration, sunlight, competition
for nutrients and water, microclimatic
condition, etc.
•	 High seed rate and dense population are
responsible for Damping-off in nursery and
disease outbreaks in the main field.</p>

<h3>Host Eradication</h3>
<p>•	 When a pathogen has been introduced
into a new area, a plant disease epidemic
frequently follows.
•	 To prevent such an epidemic, all the host
plants infected by or suspected of harboring
the pathogen may have to be removed and
burnt or buried.
•	 Crop residues or debris of previous crops
should be removed and destroyed.</p>

<h3>Sanitation</h3>
<p>•	 Sanitation consists of all activities aimed
at eliminating or reducing the amount of
inoculum present in a plant/field to prevent
the spread of the pathogens to healthy
plants/fields.
•	 It includes pruning infected plants/plant
parts/dead branches, removing infected
fruits and any other plant debris that may
harbor the pathogen helping in reducing the
inoculum.
•	 For example, in case of Cabbage and
Cauliflower crops removing the crop
residue immediately after harvest, avoids
incorporation of black rot pathogen into the
soil.
•	 Virus infected plants have to be destroyed by
burying or burning.
•	 Washing farm equipment is one of the
methods to avoid spread of diseases from
infected plants/fields to healthy plants/
fields.</p>

<h3>Raised bed system</h3>
<p>•	 Raised seedling beds avoid waterlogged
conditions, which is responsible for pre and
post emergence Damping-off.
•	 It also provides better aerated soil condition
that promotes efficient root development.
•	 In the main field, raised beds with polythene
mulching and drip irrigation helps in
reducing spreading of the soil-borne (splash
borne) diseases.</p>

<h3>Crop Rotation</h3>
<p>•	 Crop rotation causes a break in continuous
build up of inoculum due to continuous
cropping of the same crop.
•	 This is an age old practice where sources of
primary inoculum are eradicated.
•	 Pathogens with narrow host range, which
survive on living host or host residues in
soil can be controlled through crop rotation
to a large extent.
•	 Cultivating crops belonging to species
or family not attacked by that particular
pathogen (non-hosts) for 3-4 years will
greatly reduce the primary inoculum in the
soil.</p>

<h3>Creating conditions unfavorable to the pathogens
</h3>
<p>•	 Most of the plant pathogens require high
humidity and free moisture on leaf surface
for infection.
•	 Proper spacing of plants prevents creation
of high humidity on plant surface which is
unfavorable to infection by Downy mildews,
Botrytis, etc.
•	 Proper drainage of soil reduces the number
and activity of soil-borne pathogens and
nematodes.
•	 Appropriate choice of fertilizer or soil
amendments changes the soil pH, which
may be unfavorable to pathogen.
•	 Flooding fields for longer periods or drying
may also reduce the population of some soil
pathogens and nematodes.</p>

<h3>Traps and Mulches</h3>
<p>•	 Polythene sticky traps can be used
successfully to manage viral diseases, which
are spread by sucking insects like aphids,
whiteflies, thrips, etc.
•	 Aphids and whiteflies are trapped by erecting
yellow sticky traps @ 12 to 15/acre.
•	 Thrips are trapped by using blue sticky traps
@ 12 to 15/acre.
•	 By trapping sucking insects, the amount of
virus inoculum reaching the crop is reduced.
•	 Reflective aluminium or black or white or
colored polythene sheets when used as
mulches between the plants or rows, repel
and mislead the incoming insects away from
the field.
•	 Polythene mulches used over moist soil
during sunny summer days, increases the
soil temperature, which inactivates many
soil-borne pathogenic fungi, bacteria and
nematodes.
•	 Mulching with polythene sheets reduces
infection by soil-borne pathogens present
over the soil surface, particularly in annual
crops.
•	 Mulching with coloured and reflective plastic
sheets also repels insect vectors.</p>
<h3>Choice of Growing/Sowing Season</h3>
<p>•	 Choice of a growing season where risk of
disease incidence/spreading is minimum will
be advantageous.
•	 Foliar and soil-borne fungal and bacterial
disease incidence and spread is higher during
rainy season.
•	 Foliar diseases like Downy mildews, Late
blights, Rusts cause considerable damage
during winter/misty cold season.
•	 Whereas, incidence and spread of viral
diseases is higher during summer/dry
seasons, because of high multiplication rate
and short life cycle of insect vectors.
</p>

<h3>Staking or Pendal</h3>
<p>•	 Staking with bamboo poles, wood stakes, or
other sturdy material provides support and
keeps the fruits and foliage off the ground,
provides better aeration, thereby reducing
splash-borne diseases and fruit rots.
•	 Staking also facilitates field operations like
spraying, harvesting, etc., and increases
yield, size and quality of produce.</p>

<h3>Barrier crops and Intercropping</h3>
<p>•	 Three to four densely sown rows of Maize or
Sorghum on all the borders is one of the
methods to avoid entry of pathogens/insect
vectors into the crop field.
•	 Intercropping susceptible crop varieties with
non-host plants can act as a physical barrier
against spread of air-borne diseases and
reduce infection. </p>

<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>•	 Drip irrigation system reduces the spread
of soil–borne diseases (wilts/root rots) and
nematode infestation, as against flood
irrigation which increases the spread.
•	 Avoid sprinkler irrigation as it increases the
spread of foliar diseases due to splashing of
water droplets as during rains.</p>

<h3>Improving the growing conditions of plants</h3>
<p>•	 Cultural practices designed to improve the
plant vigor often enhance its resistance to
pathogens.
o	 Proper nutrition (particularly Potassium,
Calcium and Sulphur)
o	 Proper irrigation. 
o	 Proper spacing among plants.
o	 Using plant nutraceuticals like Phyton-T,
Power Plus, etc., improves plant growth
and have bolstering effect on resistance to
diseases.</p>

<h3>MECHANICAL PRACTICES</h3>
<p>•	 Remove and destroy egg masses, larvae,
pupae and adults of insect pests and diseased
parts of plants, wherever possible.
•	 Install bamboo cage cum bird perches in the
field and place parasitized egg masses inside
them for conservation of natural enemies
and withholding of pest species wherever
possible.
•	 Use light traps and destroy trapped insects.
•	 Use rope for dislodging leaf feeding larvae eg.
caseworm and leaf folders.
•	 Install bird scarer in the field, where required.
•	 Install bird perches in the field for allowing
birds to sit and feed on insects and their
immature stages viz., eggs, larvae and pupae.
•	 Use pheromones for mating disruption and
kill zone creation.
•	 Use pheromone traps for monitoring and
suppression of pest population.</p>

<h2>BIOLOGICAL CONTROL</h2>
<p>•	 Most organisms have their enemies in nature.
•	 Some natural enemies are very specific and
harm or kill only the target organisms without
harming other non-target organisms.
•	 The term ‘biological control’ has been used
in entomology to describe the use of such
live predatory insects or microbial pathogens
to suppress populations of different insect
pests.
•	 In plant pathology, the term applies to the
use of microbial antagonists to suppress
crop diseases.
•	 In both fields, the organism that suppresses
the insects or pathogens is referred to as
the Biological Control Agent (BCA).
•	 Microbial bio-control agents possess a
number of important advantages over
traditional chemical pesticides. They are
o	 Non-hazardous to humans and animals,
o	 Biodegradable and environmentally
friendly,
o	 Known to attack specific target organisms,
leaving other beneficial organisms
unaffected, and
o	 Easy to genetically modify; and can be
commercially produced. </p>

<h3>Biological control of diseases</h3>
<p>•	 Biological control refers to the purposeful
utilization of introduced or resident living
micro-organisms, to suppress the activities
and populations of one or more plant
pathogens.
•	 Many strains of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, etc., have been identified and used
against various disease causing pathogens.
•	 Several mechanisms of action are involved
in the process of biological control, like
competition, parasitism and antibiosis.
•	 In addition to biocontrol activity, they secrete
several plant growth promoting substances
which help in vigorous plant growth.</p>
<h4>Pseudomonas spp.</h4>
<p>•	 Species of P. fluorescence and P. putida are
bacterial biocontrol agents, which control
plant diseases caused by fungi such as
Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, Sclerotium, Pythium,
Colletotrichum, etc.
•	 These bacteria produce antibiotic substances
which inhibit the growth of pathogens.
•	 Bacterial pathogens like Erwinia and
Xanthomonas can also be controlled by
these bacterial bio-control agents.
</p>
<h4>Bacillus spp. </h4>
<p>•	 Many species like B. subtilis, B. cereus, B.
megatarium are also effective in controlling
various plant diseases caused by fungi and
bacteria.
•	 They produce antibiotics and siderophores,
which inhibit the growth of pathogens.</p>

<h4>Trichoderma spp.</h4>
<p>•	 Many species like Trichoderma harzianum,
T. viride, etc., are effective biocontrol agents
against various soil-borne fungal pathogens
that cause Damping-off, wilts and root rots.
•	 These control the pathogens by competing
for nutrients and also by parasitizing the
hyphae of the fungal pathogens.</p>

<h4>Recommendations for application of biocontrol agents</h4>
<p>The bio-control agents are available as powder
and liquid formulations in packs of various
volumes.
<br></br>
Seed treatment
•	 Apply 1-5 gm or 1-5 ml of formulations / kg
of seeds. Shade dry before sowing.
Seedling dip
•	 Dip the seedlings in formulation for 1-2 hrs
before planting.
Through drip
•	 Add 1 kg or 1 litre of the formulation in 100
litres of irrigation water through drip.
<br></br>
Soil application
•	 Mix the formulations in properly composted,
dried farm yard manure [FYM].
•	 Water and spread the mixture uniformly
under shade to make beds of 1 foot height
and convenient length and width.
•	 Cover the beds with gunny cloth to avoid
loss of moisture and maintain for 15-20 days
with frequent watering.
•	 Mix the above preparation again with farm
yard manure and apply by broadcasting,
applying to rows or to each pit during land
preparation or before planting
<br></br>
•	 Do not apply chemical fertilizers/pesticides for a period of 10-15 days after the application of
bio-control agents.
•	 Maintain enough moisture in the field for the multiplication and survival of bio-control agents.
</p>
<h3>Biological control of insects</h3>
<p>•	 Biological control of insect pests through
biological means is an important component
of IPM.
•	 In broader sense, biocontrol is use of living
organisms to control unwanted living
organisms (pests).
•	 In other words, deliberate use of
Parasitoids, Predators and Pathogens
to maintain pest population at levels
below those causing economic loss, either
by introducing a new bio-agent into the
environment of pest or by increasing
effectiveness of those already present in the
field.</p>

<h3>Microbial Insecticides</h3>
<p>•	 These are micro-organisms, which infest
and cause diseases in their hosts as a result
of which hosts are killed.
•	 Major groups of pathogens are fungi, viruses
and bacteria.
•	 Some nematodes also cause diseases in
certain insect pests.
•	 Important examples of fungi are different
species of Hirsutella, Beauveria, Nomuraea
rileyi and Metarhizium, which have been
reported to infest and kill a large number of
insects (upto 90%) in the fields.</p>

<h3>Viruses</h3>
<p>•	 The Baculovirus group predominantly
controls moths and butterflies.
•	 Among these, most important examples
are Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (NPV)
and granulosis viruses against species of
Helicoverpa, Spodoptera, etc</p>

<h3>Bacteria</h3>
<p>•	 Among bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis
(Bt) and B. popilliae are very important.
•	 Bt is a soil-borne, ubiquitous bacterium that
causes a disease called Septicemia in many
Lepidopteran insects including silkworms.
•	 When Bt is injested by these insects, cry
toxins paralyze the digestive tract so that the
insects stop feeding and die.
•	 Bt is commercially available in both powder
and liquid forms, and is used as bio-control
agent against caterpillars, beetles, and
mosquitoes.
•	 It controls caterpillars, borers, diamond back
moth (DBM), loopers and worms on many
crops like Cotton, Tobacco, Tomato, Potato,
Cabbage, Cucurbits, Beans, etc.
•	 When insects ingest, it dissolves in
the midgut of moths and butterflies to
release the virus particle and infect the larva.
•	 As the toxins produced by B. thuringiensis
have little effect on othernon-target organisms,
they are considered more environment
friendly than synthetic pesticides.
•	 The toxin producing gene from B.
thuringiensis (Bt toxin) has been incorporated
directly into plants through genetic
engineering.
•	 These are called Bt crops (Cotton, Corn,
Potato, Eggplant, etc.) and are being grown
successfully in many countries of the world
for over two decades now.</p>

<h3>Entomopathogenic fungi </h3>
<p>Beauveria bassiana (Cordiceps bassiana)
•	 It is a fungal biocontrol agent having
insecticidal property against Grass hoppers,
Coffee berry borer and other borers, Aphids,
Whiteflies, termites, thrips, etc. causing
white muscardine disease.
•	 As this pathogen causes the same disease in
silkworm also, care must be taken before it is
applied in sericulture area.
Metarhizium anisopliae
•	 This is another entomopathogenic fungus
which causes Green Muscardine Disease in
certain insect species.
Paecilomyces lilacinus
•	 It is a fungal biocontrol agent having
nematicidal activity against various
nematodes like root knot nematode,
burrowing nematode and root lesion
nematode.
•	 It acts against plant root nematodes by
infecting eggs, juveniles and adult females.
•	 Proper and timely use of these biopesticides
can check further spread of some destructive
insects.
Consortia of Micro-organisms
•	 Use of mixtures (consortia) of bio-control
agents has increased the effectiveness and
consistency of bio-control mechanism under
varied conditions</p>
<h3>Application of Bio-control agents</h3>
<p>Spraying
•	 Spray microbial insecticides on the foliage at
dosages recommended by the manufacturers
(0.01 - 0.1%).
•	 Spray 48 to 72 hours after incidence of
insects and repeat 1 to 3 times with 8 to 10
days intervals.
•	 Insects do not die immediately but remain
on plants for 24 - 48 hrs before dieing of
starvation.
•	 Paecilomyces lilacinus formulations should
be used for soil application/ seedling dip/
through drip irrigation.</p>

<h3>Insecticidal Antibiotics</h3>
<p>•	 While most antibiotics are antibacterials,
there are some effective fungicides and
insecticides.
•	 Antibiotics obtained from Actinomycetes
bacteria through fermentation are very
effective against many insects and mites.
• Spinosad (Success 2.5% EC and
Tracer 45% SC), fermentation
product of Saccharopolyspora
spinosa (Actinomycete), is very effective
against Lepidopteran insects and thrips.
•	 Spinetoram (Delegate 250 WG) is a new
fermentation product of Saccharopolyspora
spinosa and is very effective against thrips
and lepidopteran insects.
•	 Abamectin (Vertimec 1.9% EC) is
effective as both acaricide, insecticide and a
nematicide.
•	 Milbemectin (Milbeknock 1% EC) is
an acaricide derived from Streptomyces
hygroscopicus subsp. aureolacrimosus.
o	 Emamectin benzoate, a fermentation
product of Streptomyces avermitilis
(Proclaim 5% SG), is effective against
Lepidopteran insects.</p>

<h4>Entomopathogenic Nematodes (EPNs)</h4>
<p>•	 They are used for management of root grubs
•	 These are a group of nematodes, which
cause disease in some of harmful insects.
•	 They are multi-cellular organisms used as
bio-control agents against many types of
insects living in soil like the larval forms of
moths, butterflies, flies and beetles as well
as adult forms of beetles, grasshoppers, and
crickets.
•	 These nematodes have mutualistic
association with the bacteria of the genus
Xenorhabdus or Photorhabdus, which are
responsible for the disease in insects leading
to death.
•	 The nematodes provide shelter to the
bacteria, which in return kill the insect host
and provide nutrients to the nematode.
•	 Together, the nematodes and bacteria feed on
the decomposing host. e.g., Heterorhabditis
bacteriophora, H. megidis, Steinernema
carpocapsae, S. feltiae.</p>
<p>Parasitoids
•	 These are organisms, which lay eggs in or
on the bodies of their hosts and complete
their life cycles in host bodies, as a result of
which the hosts die.
•	 Parasitoids are grouped depending on the
developmental stages of the host in or on
which they complete their life cycle e.g.,
egg, larval, pupal, adult, egg-larval and larval
pupal parasitoids.
•	 Example are different species of
Trichogramma, Apanteles, Bracon, Chelonus,
Brachemeria, Pseudogonatopus, etc.
Predators
•	 These are free-living organisms, which prey
upon other organisms for their food.
•	 Examples are different species of Spiders,
Dragon flies, Damsel flies, Lady bird beetles,
Chrysopa species, Birds, etc.
Goniozus nephantidis laying eggs on black headed caterpillars

Trichogramma
Green lacewing Parasitic wasp (Aphelinus) Lady bird beetle
Induced male sterility
•	 Sterility is induced in males of insect pests in
the laboratory either through chemosterilants
or through radiation.
•	 Releasing of such sterile males of insects
in sufficient numbers in field to compete
with fertile males, is also useful not only in
agriculture, but also in human health care.</p>
<p>Limitations of Biocontrol agents
•	 They are sensitive to adverse environmental
conditions such as extreme dryness, heat,
and cold.
•	 Have limited shelf-life.
•	 Have limited efficacy in situations where
several pathogens are involved in disease
development and under high disease
pressure.
•	 Biocontrol agents are best used as preventive
rather than curative measures.</p>

<h3>BOTANICALS</h3>
<p>•	 These are extracts of many plant species
have insecticidal, fungicidal, bactericidal and
nematicidal properties.
Neem Based Insecticides
•	 Azadirachtin in neem extract acts as a
feeding deterrent against a number of insect
pests including beetles.
•	 It reduces the level of the insect hormone
Ecdysone causing disruption in the insect’s
moulting process.
•	 The immature larvae and nymphs remain in
the same stage and later die.
•	 After treatment with neem-based pesticides,
insects become crippled and wings are
distorted.
•	 Some soft-skinned insect larvae may even be
killed by direct contact with the spray.
•	 Although adults are not killed by the growth
regulating properties of azadirachtin, it
disrupts mating and sexual communication
resulting in reduced fecundity.
•	 The oil forms a coating on the insect’s
body, blocking the breathing openings and
suffocating the insect.
•	 It also has a repellent effect on certain insects
and mites.
•	 Neem oil prevents germination and
penetration of some fungal spores.
•	 More than 60 insect pests including aphids,
beetles, caterpillars, lace bugs, leaf hoppers,
leaf miners, mealybugs, psyllids, thrips and
whiteflies are affected by azadirachtin.
Benefits of Neem
•	 Neem does not persist in the environment
and is degraded by ultraviolet light and rain.
•	 Many neem-products have low mammalian
toxicity.
•	 They have less effect on non-target
beneficial organisms compared to some of
the traditional pesticides.
•	 It is found to have less effects on many insect
predators including spiders, earwigs and
ants but flower fly larvae are very sensitive
to neem sprays.
•	 Neem-based materials are compatible with
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices. 
•	 As azadirachtin has a number of different
modes of action, it is less likely that insects
or pathogens will develop resistance to neem
products compared to materials with a single
mode of action.</p>
<p>Karanjin
•	 Karanjin is the active ingredient of botanical
extract of Pongamia glabra/Pongamia
pinnata (Karanj tree).
•	 It is a Bio-acaricide/Bio-insecticide and is
formulated as 2% Emulsifiable concentrate
(20,000 ppm).
•	 Karanjin is non-phytotoxic.
Mode of Action
•	 Alkaloids present in Karanjin work as an
Insect growth regulator and an anti feedant
on adult and nymphs of mites and other
sucking pests like Thrips, Jassids, Whiteflies,
etc.
Target Pests
•	 Karanjin effectively controls mites, scales,
thrips and other sucking pests.
•	 It controls mites like red spider mites, scarlet
mites, yellow mites, purple mites and other
types of mites.
</p>

<h4>Annonin</h4>
<p>•	 Annonin is a botanical insecticide based
on botanical extract of Annona squamosa
(Custard Apple / Seetaphal).
•	 Squamocin (annonin) is the active ingredient
and is formulated as 1% Emulsifiable
Concentrate (10,000 ppm).
•	 Annonin is non phytotoxic and not toxic to
higher animals.
•	 Annonaceous acetogenins present in
Annonin have pesticidal and/or insect
antifeedant properties.
Target Pests
Helicoverpa armigera, H. zea, Spodoptera
litura , S. exigua, Earias spp., Achaea
janata, Nephotettix virescens, Periplaneta
americana, Callosobruchus chinensis,
Rhyzopertha dominica, Musca domestica,
Urentius echinus, Bunch caterpillar, Green
Leaf Hopper, Leaf Folder, Army worm, Cut
worm, Aphids, Brown Plant Hopper of Rice,
etc.</p>

<h4>Limitations of Botanicals </h4>
<p>•	 Botanicals have limited persistence in the
environment.
•	 Temperature, ultraviolet light, rainfall and
other environmental factors reduce their bio
-efficacy.
•	 Spray botanicals in early morning hours or
late afternoon hours for better results.
•	 Repeated applications may be needed to
achieve desired result.
•	 Because neem is an insect growth regulator,
it is effective mostly against the immature
stages of insects.
•	 In absence of an immediate knockdown
effect and insects may continue to feed, but
due to its repellant effects, insect feeding will
be reduced.
•	 Phytotoxicity (damage to plants) may be
of concern with flowers being particularly
sensitive.
•	 Newly transplanted plants with limited root
development or plants that are wilted or
under stress should not be treated.</p>

<h4>GENETIC RESISTANCE</h4>
<p>•	 Using Genetic resistance is the most
economical, ecofriendly, effective and
practical method of crop protection.
•	 These resistant crops save cost of production
by way of eliminating cost of chemicals and
sprays.
•	 Genetic resistance is the only economic way
of controling diseases such as
o	 Vascular wilts (both fungal and bacterial),
o	 Root rots, cereal rusts, powdery mildews
and viral diseases.
•	 Resistant hybrids are available in many crops
against many diseases and even insects.
•	 In recent years, genetically modified virus
resistant, blight resistant and insect resistant
varieties (Bt crops) have become very popular.
•	 The phenomenal success of Bt cotton, maize,
potato and other crops across the world
speaks about the importance of genetic
resistance.
•	 Farmers are advised to use only such resistant
hybrids, when they are available.</p>

<h3>CHEMICAL METHODS</h3>
<p>•	 Use of chemical pesticides is the last resort
when all other methods fail in preventing
economic loss due to pests and diseases.
•	 In spite of great advancement in pest
management research, pesticides continue
to play an important role in crop protection
owing to the complexity of pest problems.
•	 Use of pesticides should be need based,
and judicious, to minimise not only the
cost involved, but also to reduce associated
problems.
•	 Understand thoroughly what to spray, when
to spray, where to spray and how to spray.
•	 The dosage of the chemical varies according
to the formulation, method of application
(seed treatment, spraying, soil drenching,
pasting, etc.) and growth stage of the crop
(small seedlings, adult plants, etc.)
•	 Economic Threshold Level (ETL) and pest
defender ratio must be observed in case of
insect pests.
•	 Relatively safer pesticides should be selected.
•	 Do not use pesticides, which are highly toxic
and are known to have toxic residual effects.
•	 Continous use of same pesticides should be
avoided to avoid development of resistance in
the pest population.
•	 If pest is present in isolated strips or patches,
whole field need not be sprayed.
•	 Adopt Integrated Pest Management [IPM]
practices in vegetable and fruit crops because
of their unique mode of consumption by
human beings. </p>
