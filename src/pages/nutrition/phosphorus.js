    <h4>Phosphorus</h4>
    <p>Phosphorus is the second nutrient element and
an essential constituent of every living cell. It is
involved in all types of metabolic activities and is
an essential constituent of majority of enzymes.
It is also a structural component of membrane
system of cell, chloroplasts and mitochondria. </p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>Phosphorus stimulates root development
and growth in seedling stage. </p>
<p>It stimulates flowering, fruit setting and seed
formation and the development of roots.
</p>
<p>It hastens leaf development and encourages
greater growth of shoots and roots.</p>
<p>It enhances the development of reproductive
parts and thus bringing about early
maturity of crops particularly in cereals and
counteracts the effect of excess Nitrogen. </p>
<p>It develops resistance to certain diseases.</p>
<p>It increases the number of tillers in cereal
crops and also improves the ratio of grain
to straw. </p>
<p>It strengthens the straw of cereal crops
preventing lodging.</p>
<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>Root and shoot growth is restricted and
plants become thin, erect and spindly. 
</p>
<p>The foliage is sparse and restricted, the
development of lateral buds is suppressed.  </p>
<p>Under severe deficiency, the apical parts of
the leaves turn brown and then margin of
the leaves may roll.</p>
<p>The leaves of cereal crops become dull
grayish green in colour. </p>
<p>The deficiency is characterized by slow
growth and low yields.</p>
<p>Leaves may shed prematurely and flowering
and fruiting may be delayed considerably.</p>
<p>Growth is stunted even under abundant
supply of Nitrogen and Potassium. </p>
<p>Premature ripening of crop is seen.</p>
<p>In cereal crops, the foliage turns bluish green
and then strong reddish purple tints develop
on the nodes, internodes, leaves and even
heads. </p>
<p>The heads are poorly formed</p>
<p>Tillering decreases and results in low yields.</p>
<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Apply Phosphorus containing fertilizers
like SSP or DAP, before planting as per
recommendation.</p>
<p>Two to three soil applications @ 25 - 30 kg/
acre depending on the crop and stage helps
in managing the deficiency, </p>
<p>Spray MAP (12:61:00) @ 10 gm/ltr two to
three times at intervals of 15 days to reduce
crop loss.</p>
