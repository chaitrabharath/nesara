    <h4>Copper</h4>
    <p>Copper is capable of acting as electron carriers
in enzyme system, which brings about oxidationreduction in plants. It is an essential constituent
of enzymes.</p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>It is a constituent of chlorophyll and thus is
important for synthesis of chlorophyll.</p>
<p>It acts as a catalyst in respiration (electron
transport chain) and in utilization of Iron.</p>

<p> It is essential for the synthesis of Vitamin A.</p>


<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>It is induced by heavy liming and excessive
application of Nitrogen and Phosphorus.</p>
<p>Copper deficiency causes chlorosis, withering
and distortion of terminal leaves (white tip in
Wheat).</p>
<p>Multiple bud formation in the leaf axial
and malformation of leaves is a common
symptom. </p>
<p>Gum pockets under the bark and “Die back”
of shoots in citrus are prominent symptoms
of Cu deficiency.</p>
<p> The young leaves of cruciferous crops
develop interveinal chlorosis, mottling and
marginal scorching.</p>

<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Apply Copper Sulphate @ 3 - 5 kg /acre
before planting.</p>
<p>Spray Copper Sulphate @ 2 - 3 gm/ltr twice
at an interval of 15 days to prevent losses
due to Copper deficiency. </p>
<p>Spray multi micronutrient mixture (powder/
liquid formulations) containing the Copper at
recommended dose and intervals. </p>
