    <h4>Zinc</h4>
    <p>Zinc is a widely distributed element that occurs
in small but adequate amounts in most soils and
plants. Zinc functions in enzyme systems, which
are important in plant metabolism. </p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>It takes part in the synthesis of chlorophyll
in association with Iron and Manganese and
hence plays positive role in photosynthesis
and Nitrogen metabolism.</p>
<p> It is involved in biosynthesis of plant growth
hormone (IAA), and in the reproduction
process of certain plants</p>

<p>It is required for seed production, rate of
growth and also RNA synthesis.</p>

<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>Intervenial chlorosis of the foliage, particularly
in upper leaves, with reduction in the size of
young leaves. </p>
<p> Shortening of internodes and stunted growth
of plants.</p>
<p>Plants become severely dwarfed. </p>
<p>Flowering, fruiting and maturity can be
delayed, shoots may die off and leaves fall
prematurely</p>
<p> New leaves of Maize plant that emerge are
white in colour, hence the name ‘white bud’</p>


<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Apply Zinc sulphate @ 10-15 kg / acre before
planting.</p>
<p> Spray Zinc in the form of Zinc Sulphate @
2-3 gm or Zinc-EDTA @ 0.5 gm/ltr two to
three times at intervals of 15 days. </p>
<p>Spray micronutreint mixture (powder/
liquid formulations) containing Zinc as
recommended</p>
