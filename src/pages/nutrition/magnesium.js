    <h4>Magnesium</h4>
    <p>Magnesium is a very important constituent of
chlorophyll. Several photosynthetic enzymes
present in chlorophyll require Magnesium as cofactor. Its deficiency in soil is experienced later
than that of Potassium. </p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>Magnesium helps in the formation of
chlorophyll.</p>
<p>It is indispensable for photosynthesis and
imparts dark green color to leaves</p>

<p>It regulates the uptake of Nitrogen and
Phosphorus from the soil.</p>
<p>It increases crop resistance to drought and
diseases.</p>
<p>It helps in production and translocation of
carbohydrates, proteins, fats and vitamins.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in synthesis of oils
and fats</p>
<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>It causes yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves.</p>
<p>It causes typical interveinal chlorosis in most
of the crops where the veins remain dark
green. </p>
<p>However, in Cotton the leaves turn purplish
red.</p>
<p>Acute deficiency may cause premature
defoliation and fruit drop.</p>

<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Apply Magnesium Sulphate @ 25 - 50 kg/
acre, two to three times at intervals of 20
- 25 days depending on the crop and crop
stage. </p>
<p>Spray Magnesium Nitrate @ 5 - 10 gm/ltr
or Magnesium Sulphate @ 5 - 10 gm/ltr
two to three times at intervals of 15 days for
immediate recovery. </p>
