    <h4>Calcium</h4>
    <p>Calcium is an important component of cell wall
and is required in large quantities for cell division.
It is a structural constituent of chromosomes.
Excessive amounts of Calcium can decrease the
availability of many micronutrients.</p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>Calcium promotes root development and
growth of plant as it is involved in root
elongation and cell division.</p>
<p>It is an essential co-factor or an activator of
a number of enzymes</p>

<p>It induces stiffness of straw and prevents
lodging of plants.</p>
<p>It increases the crop resistance to certain
diseases.</p>
<p>It corrects the soil pH and improves the
intake of other nutrients like Nitrogen, Iron,
Boron, Zinc, Copper and Manganese.</p>
<p>The structure of soil having Calcium
becomes good and cation exchange capacity
increases.</p>
<p>Calcium acts as a buffer and ameliorates the
toxic effects of other nutrients if they are at
toxic levels in the plant.</p>

<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>Symptoms of Calcium deficiency resemble
those of Boron deficiency.</p>
<p>Calcium deficiency causes chlorosis of young
leaves, hooked terminal buds and die back of
shoots.</p>
<p>Leaves become wrinkled and the young
leaves remain folded.</p>
<p>It causes typical “blossom end rot” of many
fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>The normal growth of the plant is arrested
and premature falling of flowers and fruits is
observed.</p>
<p>Roots become short, stubby and brown.</p>
<p>Calcium deficiency causes acidity of soil.</p>

<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Broadcast soil amendments like Gypsum/
Lime before planting @ 200 - 300 kg/acre
based on soil analysis report. </p>
<p>Apply any of the Calcium containing
fertilizers like Calcium Nitrate (CN), SSP or
Gypsum as per the deficiency level.</p>
<p>Spray Calcium Nitrate @ 5 - 10 gm/ltr., two
to three times at intervals of 10 days until
crop recovers from the deficiency.</p>
