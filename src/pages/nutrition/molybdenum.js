    <h4>Molybdenum</h4>
    <p>Molybdenum has been found to be essential for
certain Nitrogen transformation in microbes as
well as in plants. It is thought to be an essential
component in the process of Nitrogen fixation.
Molybdenum concentrations in soil are lesser
than those of any other elements.</p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>It enhances symbiotic Nitrogen fixation and
protein synthesis.</p>
<p>It regulates the activities of several enzymes.</p>

<p>It plays an essential role in the absorption
and translocation of Iron in plants.</p>

<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>Most of the vegetable crops are prone to
Molybdenum deficiency</p>
<p>It produces “whip tail” in Cauliflower, Broccoli
and other Brassica crops and “Downward
Cupping” in Radish.</p>
<p>It inhibits flower formation. </p>
<p>If they do form, they abscise before setting
fruits.</p>
<p>It reduces root nodulation in legumes and fail
to fix the normal amounts of Nitrogen.</p>

<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Spray Ammonium Molybdate /Sodium
Molybdate @ 0.5 gm/ltr., 2-3 times at
intervals of 15 days if deficiency is observed.</p>
<p>Treat the seeds @ 10 gm per kg seed in
Leguminous crops for better nodulation, and
Nitrogen.</p>
