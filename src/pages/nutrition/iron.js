    <h4>Iron</h4>
    <p>Iron is necessary for the synthesis of chlorophyll.
But it is not a constituent of chlorophyll. Apple,
Banana, Tomato, Onion, and Carrot contain
high percentage of Iron. Iron is absorbed by
plants as Ferrous ion.</p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>Iron takes part in the synthesis of chlorophyll
and imparts dark green colour to plants.</p>
<p>It is essential for the synthesis of proteins
contained in chloroplast.</p>

<p>It has a catalytic role in the activities of
several enzymes and regulates respiration,
photosynthesis and reduction of Nitrates and
Sulphates. </p>
<p>It also plays an important role in formation
and activity of a series of respiratory
enzymes.</p>

<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>Chlorosis of young leaves with the veins
remaining green. </p>
<p>Leaves become pale white due to loss of
chlorophyll.</p>
<p>Under severe deficiency, leaves become dry
and papery and may later turn brown and
necrotic</p>
<p>Complete leaf fall may occur and shoots can
also die.</p>
<p> Deficiency of Iron produces chlorosis in
Paddy, Ginger, Beans and mottle leaf and
chlorosis of young leaves in Sugarcane.</p>

<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Apply Ferrous Sulphate @ 10 - 15 kg / acre
before planting.</p>
<p>Spray Iron in the form of Ferrous Sulphate @
2-3 gm/ltr. or Fe-EDTA @ 0.5 gm/ltr., two
to three times at the interval of 15 days.  </p>
<p> Spray micronutreint mixture (powder/
liquid formulations) containing Iron at
recommended dose and intervals.</p>
