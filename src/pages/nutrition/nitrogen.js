    <h4>Nitrogen</h4>
    <p>Nitrogen is the first and very important fertilizer
    element for plants and has the quickest and
    most pronounced effect on plant development.
    It forms a constituent of every living cell in the
    plants. It is an essential constituent of protein
    and chlorophyll and is involved in photosynthesis,
    respiration and protein synthesis.</p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p> Nitrogen tends primarily to encourage above
ground vegetative growth and it imparts dark
green colour to plants. </p>
<p> Nitrogen is a regulator that governs to
a considerable degree the utilization
of Potassium, Phosphorus and other constituents.</p>

<p> It promotes vegetative growth and improves
the quality of produce including fodder, leafy
vegetables and food crops.</p>
<p> It increases tillering in cereal crops. </p>

<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>The older leaves are affected first.</p>
<p> The plant becomes yellowish or light green
in colour and remains stunted.</p>
<p>The leaves and young fruits tend to drop
prematurely.</p>
<p>Nitrogen deficient plant ripens prematurely
and gives poor yield.</p>
<p> The kernels of cereals and the seed of other
crops do not attain their normal size, become
shrivelled and light in weight.</p>
<p>The flower bud often turns pale and sheds
prematurely.</p>
<p>Root growth is severely affected and tillering
in cereal crops is greatly reduced.</p>

<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Apply recommended dose of Nitrogen
fertilizers as per crop requirement and soil
fertility status.</p>
<p> Apply any of the Nitrogen containing
fertilizers like Urea, Ammonium Sulphate,
DAP when deficiency symptoms appear.</p>
<p> Spray Urea, Ammonium Sulphate, Calcium
Nitrate or Potassium Nitrate @ 10 gm/ltr
two to three times at intervals of 15 days to
enable plants to recover from deficiency</p>
