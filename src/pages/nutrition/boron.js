    <h4>Boron</h4>
    <p>Most of available Boron in soil is associated with
organic matter. Along with Calcium, it plays very
important role in development of reproductive
organs and terminal buds. Normal leaves contain
between 25 and 100 ppm Boron.</p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>Boron plays an important role in the
development and differentiation of tissue,
carbohydrate metabolism and translocation
of sugar in plants. </p>
<p> It makes up for the Calcium deficiency to
some extent.</p>

<p>It helps in the normal growth of plant and in
absorption of Nitrogen in soil.</p>
<p>It helps in root development and flower and
pollen grain formation.</p>

<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>Symptoms vary with the plant type, age,
condition of growth and the severity of the
deficiency. 
</p>
<p> Each crop produces its characteristic
growth abnormalities associated with Boron
deficiency. </p>
<p>Corking and pitting of fruits in Arecanut,
Tomatoes, Banana, bumpy fruits in Papaya,
hollow stem and bronzing of curd in
Cauliflower, misshapes in Cucurbits, etc</p>
<p>Boron deficiency is often found to be
associated with sterility and malformation of
reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Boron deficiency decreases the rate of water
absorption and of translocation of sugar in
plants.</p>
<p>Seeds also fail to mature without Boron.</p>
<p>Boron deficiency also retards uptake of
Calcium.</p>

<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Apply 2-3 kg of Borax per acre before
planting.</p>
<p>Spray Boron (Solubor, Folibor) @ 2-3 gm/ltr,
two to three times at intervals of 15 days to
overcome the deficiency.</p>
<p>Spray micronutreint mixture (powder/
liquid formulations) containing Boron as
recommended. </p>
