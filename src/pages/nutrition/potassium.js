    <h4>Potassium</h4>
    <p>Potassium is the third fertilizer element required
for the quality of produce. Potassium acts as a
chemical traffic policeman, root booster, stalk
strengthener, food former, sugar and starch
transporter, protein builder, breathing regulator,
water stretcher and more importantly as a
disease retarder. But it is not effective without its
co-nutrients, Nitrogen and Phosphorus.</p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>Potassium is an essential element for the
development of chlorophyll and thereby
photosynthesis, i.e., converting carbon dioxide and hydrogen into sugars and starch
formation. </p>
<p> It is therefore of special value for crops like
Sugarcane and Potatoes.</p>

<p> It enables the crop to withstand adverse
climatic conditions (stress) by improving the
health and vigour of the plant.</p>
<p> It strengthens the straw of cereals and thus
reduces lodging.</p>
<p>It improves the quality of crops like vegetables,
fruits, Sugarcane, Potato, Tobacco, etc.</p>
<p>It increases the crop resistance to certain
diseases and counteracts the damaging
effects of excess nitrogen</p>
<p>Potassium plays a very important role in
production of quality fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>It improves the plumpness and boldness of
grains and seeds.</p>
<p>In general, it exerts a balancing effect on
both Nitrogen and Phosphorus.</p>

<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>Potassium deficiency can be observed in
older leaves.</p>
<p> It causes chlorosis i.e., yellowing of leaves
and leaf scorch in most fruit crops</p>
<p>The tips or margins of lower leaves become
scorched or burnt (typical rim firing).</p>
<p>Growth is reduced with shortening of
internodes and plants appear bushy.</p>
<p>It is also responsible for the “dying back tips”
of shoots.</p>
<p>Deficiency has been observed to reduce the
resistance of plants to infection by bacterial
and fungal pathogens, which frequently
infect the chlorotic areas between the veins</p>


<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Apply any of the Potassium containing
fertilizers like Muriate of Potash or Sulphate
of Potash or 10:26:26 </p>
<p>Apply additional quantity of Potash
depending on the crop and stage of the crop. </p>
<p>Spray Potassium Nitrate or Sulphate of
Potash @ 5 - 10 gm/ltr., two to three times
at intervals of 15 days.</p>
