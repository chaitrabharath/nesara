    <h4>Manganese</h4>
    <p>Manganese is an essential constituent of
chlorophyll and also for formation of oils and
fats. It is an important factor in photosynthesis,
nitrogen metabolism and respiration. It influences
the uptake and utilization of other nutrients. </p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>It helps in the synthesis of chlorophyll.</p>
<p>It acts as catalyst in oxidation-reduction
reactions.</p>

<p>It helps in the protein synthesis in chloroplast.</p>
<p>It also supports the movement of Iron in
plants.</p>

<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>Manganese deficiency symptoms are first
visible in younger leaves.</p>
<p>Newer leaves first become pale green and
then turn pale yellow.</p>
<p>It leads to interveinal chlorosis and netveined
leaves. </p>
<p>Plants like Banana with leaves that have
parallel veins develop a general chlorotic
condition.</p>

<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Apply Manganese Sulphate @ 10 -15 kg /
acre to avoid deficiency.</p>
<p>Spray of Manganese Sulphate @ 2.5 gm/ltr
3 - 4 times at the intervals of 15 days to
overcome the deficiency</p>
