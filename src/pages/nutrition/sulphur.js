    <h4>Sulphur</h4>
    <p>Sulphur is an important nutrient for oil seeds,
crucifers, sugar and pulse crops. As such, these
crops grow best on sulphur rich soil. It is an
essential constituent of many proteins, enzymes
and certain non-volatile compounds such as
mustard oil. Sulphur has a specific role in
initiating synthesis of protein. </p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>Sulphur is a master nutrient for oil seed
production.</p>
<p>It is essential for the synthesis of certain
amino acids (Methionine and Cysteine) and
oils. </p>
<p>It hastens root growth and stimulates seed
formation.</p>
<p>Pungent odour of Onion and Garlic is due to
the presence of sulphur.</p>
<p>It is an important constituent of straw and
plant stalks.</p>
<p>It promotes nodule formation on the root of
leguminous plants.</p>

<h4>Deficiency Symptoms</h4>
<p>Sulphur deficiency can easily be mistaken
for Nitrogen deficiency as it causes overall
chlorosis of the entire foliage. 
</p>
<p>In Sulphur deficiency yellowing begins in the
middle leaves and moves up the plant. </p>
<p>Whereas in N deficiency yellowing starts
distinctly in the lower leaves and symptoms
progress sequentially up to younger leaves.</p>
<p>The chlorosis persists even after nitrogen
application.</p>
<p>It could also be mistaken for deficiencies of
Iron and Zinc. However, these micronutrient
deficiencies will appear in young leaves.</p>
<p>The first step in finding out which nutrient
is scarce, is to identify where the chlorosis
starts on the plant.</p>
<p>Causes poor nodulation in legumes leading
to reduced Nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>In fruit crops, the fruits become light green,
deformed, thick skinned and less juicy.</p>
<p>The older foliage may develop orange or
reddish tints and shed prematurely.</p>
<p>Roots and stems become abnormally long
and develop woodiness.</p>
<p>Sulphur deficient plants produce less protein
and oil.</p>

<h4>Management</h4>
<p>Apply any of the Sulphur containing
fertilizers like Gypsum, Single Super
Phosphate, Ammonium Sulphate,
Magnesium Sulphate to deficient soil.</p>
<p>Spray liquid Sulphur @ 2.5 ml/lit. or
Ammonium Sulphate or Magnesium
Sulphate @ 10 gm/ltr two to three times at
intervals of 15 days.</p>
