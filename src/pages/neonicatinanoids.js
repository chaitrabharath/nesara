<h3>Neonicatinanoids</h3>
<p>[What are they] Neonicatinanoids are a class of insecticides chemically similar to nicotine.Some common examples include Imidacloprid, Thiamethoxam,Clothianidin, Acetamiprid, Thiacloprid, Dinotefuran and Nitenpyram.</p>
<p></p>

<p>[How do they work]Neonicatinanoids overstimulate and block acetylcholine receptors in central nervous system, leading to paralysis and death in insects. Their effects on mammals are less pronounced due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier and differences in the amino acid profiles of the neurotransmitter receptors.</p>
<p>Neonicotinoids are typically water soluble and sometimes mixed into a crop's water supply, although a more common method is to apply them to seeds so that it can be soaked up when the seed comes into contact with water and its roots form. Approximately 95% of the chemical is relased into the broader environment using this method (Goulson 2014). The chemical is found throughout the plant tissue when applied to seeds</p>
<p>[How do you know how much to use?] If used, neonicotinoids should be applied during midday during periods of minimal wind at least 24 hours before rainfall. Use coarse water droplets. These strategies will minimize runoff and drift to collateral sites. Do not apply until after flowering is complete and petals have fallen to minimize impact on bees. Only use enough to minimize economic losses. Ensure vegitative buffer zones exist between appliaction site and waterways.</p>
<p>[What are the risks?] Neonicanitinoids are believed to be detrimental to the health of local bee populations, and tend to reduce other non-target insect populations. This can lead to seconday ecologial impacts on populations that prey on those insect populations. Three of the most commonly used variants are banned across the EU, and the most common - Imidacloprid - is also banned in Canada. /p>
