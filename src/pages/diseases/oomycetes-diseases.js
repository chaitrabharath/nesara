<h2>Diseases</h2>
<h3>Diseases Caused by Oomycetes</h3>
<p>The Oomycetes, also called ‘Water molds’,
are a group of fungal-like organisms (FLO)
that until about 1990 were considered to be
true fungi.
•	 They differ from fungi in several features.
•	 With a few exceptions, the vast majority
of oomycetes have cell walls composed of
glucans and small amounts of cellulose, but
no chitin as in the cell walls of true fungi.
•	 The vegetative state of Oomycetes is
diploid, unlike true fungi that are haploid or
dikaryotic.
•	 Their mycelium is aseptate (coenocytic)
without cross walls.
•	 They are now placed in the kingdom
Chromista (=Stramenopila), but continue
to be treated as fungi because of many
similarities between them, at least in the way
they cause diseases in plants.
•	 They produce oospores as their resting
spores and zoospores or zoosporangia as
their asexual spores.
•	 Two orders Saprolegniales and Peronoporales
contain the most important plant pathogenic
Oomycetes.
•	 Of the Saprolegniales, genus Aphanomyces
has important plant pathogens including the
one that causes root rot diseases of many
annual plants, particularly of Pea and Sugar
beet.
•	 The order Peronoporales includes several
important genera of plant pathogens known,
like Pythium, Phytophthora and Albugo,
each consisting of many pathogenic species, and several genera causing downy mildews.
o Pythium spp., cause seed rot, seedling
damping off, and root rot of several
plants, and also of soft rots of fleshy fruits
in contact with the soil.
o Phytophthora spp., cause late blight of
Potato, root rots, fruit rots, and blights of
many annual and perennial plants; root
and stem rots, cankers and diebacks in
trees.
o Bremia, Peronospora, Plasmopara
and Pseudoperonospora, cause very
destructive diseases know as downy
mildews of dicotyledonous plants, such
as Lettuce, Grapes and Cucurbits.
o Peronosclerospora, Sclerophthora,
and Scelorospora cause downy mildew
diseases of monocots such as corn,
Sorghum, Pearl millet, Sugarcane, etc.
o Albugo spp., cause the common white
rust diseases of Cruciferous plants.
•	 Plant diseases caused by Oomycetes are
basically of two types.
o Diseases that affect plant parts present in
the soil or in contact with the soil, e.g.,
roots, lower stems, tubers, seeds, and
fleshy fruits lying on the soil; they are
caused by all the species of Aphanomyces
and Pythium and by some species of
Phytophthora.
o Diseases that affect only or primarily
above ground plant parts, particularly
the leaves, young stems, and fruits, e.g.,
species of Phytophthora, all downy
mildews, and Albugo.</p>

<h4>Downy Mildews</h4>
<p>Hosts: Cucurbits, Tomato, Crucifers, Beans, Potato, Radish, Grapes, Onion, Rose, Maize,
Sorghum, Wheat, Rice and many other crops.
Causal Organisms:
 • Pseudoperonospora cubensis,
• Peronospora sparsa, P. destructor, P. parasitica,
• Sclerospora macrospora, S. graminicola,
• Plasmopara viticola,
• Peronosclerospora sorghi, P. maydis and many other species.
Distribution: Worldwide</p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Symptoms of downy mildew occur on leaves,
stems, floral parts and fruits.
•	 Initial symptoms appear as small, pale yellow
spots with indefinite borders on the upper
leaf surface and water-soaked lesions on the
corresponding underside of leaves.
•	 Purplish discoloration of the upper leaf
surface can be observed on some hosts.
•	 A downy growth (sporangiophores) may be
observed on the underside of the leaf directly
under the yellow spots or on leaves, floral parts, stems or fruits early in the morning or
when foliage is wet.
•	 As the lesions expand, they may remain
chlorotic and yellow or become necrotic and
brown.
•	 When the disease is severe, whole leaves die.
•	 Disease incidence and spread is high under
humid, cool conditions during winter and
rainy seasons.
•	 High relative humidity and presence of free
moisture on leaves favor disease outbreaks.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>Downy mildew is caused by various species
of Oomycetes.
•	 This obligate pathogen forms mycelium and
haustoria inside the host tissues.
•	 The sporangiophores that emerge through
the stomata are dichotomously branched and
terminate in slender tips.
•	 A single ovoid to ellipsoid sporangium is borne
on each sub acute tip of sporangiophores</p>
<p>Sporangia are thin walled, hyaline, elliptical
with a papilla at their distal end.
•	 They germinate by producing flagellate
zoospores, which are 10 - 13µm in diameter,
although there are reports of germination by
germ tubes.
•	 Sexual oospores are globular and thick
walled.</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>The downy mildew pathogens are obligate
endoparasites.
•	 Cool (20 - 250
C) and wet conditions with
high relative humidity (85 percent or higher),
favour the downy mildew outbreaks.
•	 The pathogen produces sporangia (asexual
stage) and oospores (sexual stage), both of
which can infect plants.
•	 The pathogen overwinters in or on plant
parts as mycelium or oospores (resting stage
of the pathogen).</p>
<p>Spread of inoculum is usually by air currents
but it may also be dispersed by rain splash or
by contact through workers or tools.
•	 Prolonged periods of leaf wetness promote
spore germination and the disease spread.
•	 The pathogen survives on alternate hosts/
weeds and as oospores (sexual spores) during
absence of host and unfavourable conditions.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>Grow only resistant varieties, when available.
•	 Rotate crop with non-host varieties.
•	 Maintain adequate spacing and proper
orientation of rows to facilitate flow of air to
reduce the spread of secondary infection.
•	 Treat seeds with Metalaxyl 35% SD (Apron)
@ 4 to 5 gm/ kg seed.
•	 In case of Maize, seed treatment alone is
sufficient to manage the disease, as the
fungicide gives protection upto 30 days and
thereafter the plant becomes resistant to
aerial infection.
•	 Spray any of the following fungicides:
o	 Fenamidone + Mancozeb 10% +50%
WG (Sectin) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Pyraclostrobin + Metiram 5% + 55%
WG (Cabrio Top) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Iprovalicarb + Propineb 5.5% +
62.1% WP (Melody Duo) @ 3 gm/ltr. or</p>
<p>o	 Dimethomorph 50% WP (Acrobat) @
1.25 gm/ltr. or
o	 Famoxadone + Cymoxanil 16.6% +
22.1% SC (Equation Pro) @1 ml/ltr. or
o	 Cymoxanil + Mancozeb 8% + 64 %
WP (Curzate) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Mancozeb + Mefenoxam 64% + 8 %
WP (Ridomil Gold) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Metalaxyl + Mancozeb 8% + 64 %
WP (Master/Matco) @ 3 gm/ltr.
•	 Add Phyton-T (5 ml/lit) along with any of
the above mentioned fungicides for effective
control of the disease and rejuvenation of
the affected plants.
•	 Repeat the spray 2 - 3 times at 7-8 days
intervals to completely control the disease.
•	 Keep changing the fungicides for better
control and to avoid development of
resistance.</p>

<h5>LATE BLIGHT OF TOMATO AND POTATO</h5>
<p>Hosts: Tomato and Potato
Causal Organism: Phytophthora infestans
Distribution: Worldwide</p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>The pathogen attacks all above ground parts
of the Tomato and Potato plants.
•	 At first, irregular, greenish-black, watersoaked patches appear on the older leaves.
•	 These spots enlarge rapidly, and in moist
weather, sometimes a white, downy growth
of the fungus develops on their lower
surfaces.
•	 Later, only a ring of moldy growth may be
observed around the undersides of large
brown lesions.
•	 Infected foliage becomes brown, shrivel and
soon die.
•	 Petioles and stems are affected in a similar
manner, so that the whole plant may die. </p>
<p>•	 Lesions on fruits appear as dark, olivaceous,
greasy spots, which enlarge to invade the
entire fruit.
•	 During moist weather, thin white mycelium is
seen covering the fruit lesions.
•	 Soft rot often follows late blight infection
leading to disintegration of the fruit.
•	 In Potato tubers, infection causes purple
discoloration of the skin followed by
brownish dry/wet rot, which extends below
the surface. </p>
<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>Phytophthora infestans produces
microscopic, asexual structures called
sporangia.
•	 These sporangia are hyaline (clear), lemonshaped and 20-40 µm long.
•	 When placed in water or in very high relative
humidity, the cytoplasm in the sporangia
divides and many swimming zoospores
emerge from each sporangium.
•	 Sporangia are formed on specialized
branches called sporangiophores.
•	 The branched sporangiophore, with swellings
at the points where sporangia were attached
are distinctive for Phytophthora infestans and
useful for identification of this pathogen. </p>
<p>In the absence of sufficient water or at
temperatures above 240
C, no zoospores
form.
•	 However, sporangia germinate producing
germ tubes that penetrate the host.
•	 Both A1 and A2 compatibility types need to
be present for sexual spores or oospores to
be produced.
•	 Both compatibility types must infect the
same plant or tuber for oospores to form.
•	 A single oospore is produced within a larger
oogonium (mother cell) and the antheridium
(male cell) is at the base.
•	 Oospores have thickened walls and are
believed to survive in soil between cropping
seasons.</p>
<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>The pathogen survives on diseased plant
debris and becomes active during cool and
humid weather.
•	 Cool nights and warm days as in winter
months, are favorable for the disease.
•	 Temperatures above 300 C are unfavorable.</p>
<p>When the weather is favorable, the disease
spreads like wild fire and whole field can be
destroyed within a few days.
•	 Hence, take up management steps as soon
as the first symptoms of the disease are
noticed, during favorable seasons.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Do not cultivate Potatoes following a Tomato
crop in the same field.
•	 Avoid planting Tomatoes near Potato fields.
•	 Eliminate all Potato cull piles in the vicinity
and destroy volunteer Potato plants that
grow from over-wintered tubers.
•	 Rotate crops with non-host crops.
•	 Spray any of the following fungicides:
o	 Fenamidone and Mancozeb 10% +
50% WG (Sectin) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Dimethomorph 50% WP (Acrobat) @
1.25 gm/ltr. or
o	 Famoxadone + Cymoxanil 16.6% +
22.1% SC (Equation Pro) @ 1 ml/ltr. or
o	 Iprovalicarb + Propineb 5.5% +
62.1% WP (Melody duo) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Cymoxanil and Mancozeb 8% + 64 % WP
(Curzate) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Mancozeb and Mefenoxam 64% + 8 %
WP (Ridomil Gold) @ 3 gm/ltr or
o	 Metalaxyl and Mancozeb 8% + 64%
WP (Master/Matco) @ 3 gm/ltr.
•	 Add Phyton-T (@ 5 ml/ltr) along with
any of the above mentioned fungicides
for effective control of the disease and
rejuvenation of affected plants.
•	 Repeat the spray 2-3 times at 7-8 days
intervals to completely control the disease.
•	 If the problem is severe, change the fungicides
and spray</p>

<h5>PHYTOPHTHORA BLIGHT OF CHILLIES</h5>
<p>Hosts: Chilli and Capsicum
Causal Organism: Phytophthora capsici
Distribution: Worldwide</p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Symptoms appear on leaves as circular,
grayish brown, water-soaked lesions.
•	 The pathogen causes root and crown rot
and distinctive black lesions on stems.
•	 Root infection can lead to the death of
plants.</p>
<p>Phytophthora capsici also infects fruits,
causing lesions, which are covered with
white sporangia.
•	 Defoliation and complete loss of plants can
occur in heavily infected fields</p>
<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>Phytophthora capsici reproduces by both
sexual and asexual means.
•	 It produces sporangia on branched
sporangiophores.
•	 The sporangia are generally ovoid and have
prominent papilla at the apex.
•	 The pathogen produces oospores, the
sexual spores, which overwinter in the field
and serve as primary inoculum</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>Rotate crop with non-hosts.
•	 Maintain adequate spacing among plants
and rows.
•	 Manage soil moisture and avoid splash-borne
infection by employing mulching sheets.
•	 Spray any of the following fungicides like
o	 Fenamidone + Mancozeb 10% + 50%
WG (Sectin) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Dimethomorph 50% WP (Acrobat) @
1.25 gm/ltr. or
Symptoms
o	 Mancozeb + Mefenoxam 64% + 8 %
WP (Ridomil Gold) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Metalaxyl + Mancozeb 8% + 64 %
WP (Master/Matco) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
•	 Drench the root rot affected plants with
200 - 300 ml solution containing Metalaxyl
35% (Mould) @ 1 gm/ltr. + Mancozeb
75% (DM-45) @ 2 gm/ltr. + Phyton-T @
5 ml/ltr.</p>

<h5>QUICK WILT and PHYTOPHTHORA BLIGHT OF BLACK PEPPER</h5>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>These diseases are alo caused by Phytopthora
capsici.
•	 The pathogen infects all parts of the plant
like leaf, stem, spike, collar and root.
•	 Symptoms appear on leaves as circular
water-soaked lesions, which expand into
dark brown patches with fimbriate (hairlike/
finger like projections) margin.
•	 Foliar infection leads to varying degrees of
defoliation depending on the severity of
disease.
•	 On tender and woody stems, infection occurs
as dark wet spots resulting in progressive
rotting, leading to die-back symptoms.
•	 Infection also occurs on spike resulting in
spike shedding.
•	 Collar and root infections are the most
serious and infected vine shows rapid wilting,
defoliation and quick death (quick wilt).
•	 The collar (foot) infection spreads upwards
and downwards resulting in rotting of stem
and roots.
•	 The collar infected vines show yellowing
and flaccidity of leaves, defoliation, spike
shedding and breaking of stem at the nodal
regions. </p>
<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>•	 The pathogen survives on infected plant
debris throughout the year, serving as the
source of primary inoculum.
•	 Disease spreads through soil, water, rain
splash, root contact, contaminated materials,
termites and slugs.
•	 Low temperatures (22-29 C), shorter
duration of sunshine hours, high rainfall
and high relative humidity (>75%) favor the
increase of disease incidence and severity.
•	 The infections are initially noticed with
the onset of monsoon during May-June on
tender runner shoots, which lay spread on
the ground.
•	 Abundant spores, produced on rotting
shoots get splashed around during rain,
infecting nearby leaves and stems.
•	 With continuous rain splashing, the
pathogen gradually spreads from the lower
leaves to upper portions of the vine.
•	 However, root and collar infections continue,
even after monsoon, so long as soil moisture
level is conducive.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>An integrated approach involving
phytosanitation, quarantine measures,
appropriate cultural practices, timely chemical
control measures followed by maintenance
with biological control agents is necessary for
successful management of this deadly disease.
•	 Use disease free cuttings/seedlings for
planting.
•	 Remove and destroy infected plants/plant
materials by burning or burying.
•	 Prune and tie the runners before south west
monsoon.
•	 Ensure proper drainage and prevent
stagnation of water in the plantation.
•	 Mulch the basins to prevent rain splash.
•	 Avoid root injury during various farm
activities to reduce the incidence of foot rot.
•	 Drench the root zone of affected and
surrounding vines with a solution containing
following ingredients @ 5 - 10 litres/plant.
•	 Repeat the drenching after 15-20 days to
reduce the load of inoculum in the soil.
•	 Spray the same solution on the affected and
surrounding plants.
•	 Use biological control agents like
Trichoderma, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, etc.,
after 15-20 days of chemical treatment.
•	 Repeat both chemical and biological control
agents treatment twice in a year during May
and September months.
•	 In addition to the above treatments, apply
the paste of Bordeaux mixture (10 -15%) on
the stems of the vines up to a height of 3
feet from the soil line to prevent the disease
incidence.</p>
<p>Phyton-T (Resistance booster) 5 ml/ltr
Thiophanate Methyl (Roak) 2 gm/ltr
Chlorpyriphos (Dursban) 2 ml/ltr
Mancozeb & Mefenoxam 64% +
8% WP (Ridomil Gold)
3 gm/ltr
Calcium Nitrate 5 gm/ltr
Note: Before drenching, create a basin by loosening the
soil without damaging the roots</p>

<h5>Diseases caused by Species of Pythium</h5>
<h5>Damping-off</h5>
<p>•	 Damping-off is widely distributed all over
the world, affecting almost all kinds of
vegetables, cereals, fruits and forest trees.
•	 Although many other fungal (Phytophthora,
Sclerotinia, Rhizoctonia, Fusarium,
Cercospora, etc.) and bacterial pathogens
(Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas) are involved,
Pythium is the most important pathogen
responsible for Damping-off.
•	 Several species of Pythium like P.
aphanidermatum, P. debaryanum, P.
ultimum, P. irregulare are commonly
involved.</p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Death due to Damping-off can occur either
before or after emergence.
•	 In pre-emergence Damping-off, the seeds
fail to germinate and rot inside the soil.
•	 In post-emergence, the pathogens attack the
young tissues at or near the soil line (ground
level).
•	 The affected seedlings commonly show
a lesion initially water-soaked, becoming
necrotic, extending from the roots up the
hypocotyls and sometimes reaching growing
points.
•	 The infected seedlings look much thinner
and softer than the healthy ones.
•	 Once infected, the roots will begin to
disintegrate, rot and finally seedlings
collapse.</p>

<h5>FRUIT ROT OF CUCURBITS (COTTONY LEAK)</h5>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Pythium fruit rot, also known as cottony
leak, affects most Cucurbits.
•	 Lesions start as water-soaked spots, on both
green and ripe fruits, where fruits touch the
wet soil.
•	 When humidity is high, a white cottony
growth will cover the surface of the lesions.
•	 When the epidermis is ruptured, the fruit
quickly collapses.
•	 The disease is most severe on cucumber, but
Watermelon, Pumpkin, and Melon can also
be affected.</p>

<h5>Foot Rot of Papaya</h5>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Initial symptoms appear as water-soaked
patches on the stem near the ground level.
•	 These patches enlarge rapidly and girdle the
stem, causing rotting of the tissues, which
then turn dark brown or black.
•	 When disease severity is low, partial stem rot
is seen and the plants remain stunted.
•	 Fruits, if formed, are shrivelled and
malformed.
•	 Terminal leaves turn yellow and drop off.
•	 When the disease becomes severe the entire
plant topples over and dies.</p>

<h5>RHIZOME ROT/SOFT ROT OF GINGER</h5>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>The initial infection occurs at the collar
region of the pseudostem and progresses
both upwards as well as downwards.
•	 Infected pseudostem becomes water-soaked
and the rot spreads to the rhizome resulting
in soft rot.
•	 Symptoms on leaves appear as light
yellowing of the tips of leaf blades of lower
leaves, which gradually spreads to the upper
leaves.
•	 In early stages, the middle portion of the
leaves remain green while the margins
become yellow.
•	 The yellowing spreads to entire plant,
followed by drooping, withering and drying
of pseudostems.
•	 Affected rhizomes show a brown
discoloration and are normally shrivelled.
•	 As rotting progresses, the outer shell remains
intact with only fibrous internal tissue.
•	 In addition to Pythium other fungi like
Fusarium, Rhizoctonia and bacteria like
Pseudomonas are also involved.</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>The oospores and saprophytic mycelium
present in the soil on organic matter serve
as primary source of inoculum.
•	 The pathogen turns parasitic when the host
plants become available and the growing
conditions are favorable.
•	 Soil moisture (dampness) and soil
temperature have high influence on disease
incidence and severity.
•	 Waterlogging in the field due to poor drainage
increases the intensity of the disease.
•	 Excessive rains and relatively high
temperatures (32 - 360 C) are most favorable
environmental factors that generally result in
severe disease incidence.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>The mycelium of Pythium species is
colorless, slender, coenocytic, profusely
branching and rapidly growing.
•	 It produces terminal or intercalary sporangia,
which are of various sizes and shapes (oval
or globose) depending on the species.
•	 Sporangia and zoospores are produced
when conditions are favorable, particularly
during availability of free moisture.
•	 At the end of growing season, the pathogen
initiates sexual reproduction to produce
oospores.
•	 The oospores are also called as resting
spores and are resistant to unfavorable
conditions.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>For Damping-off
•	 Use disease free, certified seeds.
•	 Treat the seeds with Metalaxyl 35% WP
(Apron) @ 2 - 5 gm/kg + Carbendazim
50% WP (Bavistin/GLSTIN) @ 2 - 5 gm/
kg before sowing.
•	 Never excessively water the seed beds or
trays.
•	 Sterilize the seed beds before sowing by
drenching up to four inches depth with
Formaldehyde diluted 50 times in water
or a combination of Metalaxyl 35%
WP (Apron/ Mould/ Top 35) and
Carbendazim 50% WP (Bavistin /
GLSTIN) @ 1 gm/ltr., each.
•	 Add Phyton-T @ 3 ml/ltr to the fungicides
for better root growth and sturdy seedling
growth.
•	 Repeat the fungicidal drenching along with
Phyton-T in 7-10 days after sowing.

For Foot rot and Rhizome rot
•	 Prevent waterlogged condition by providing
proper drainage.
•	 Install drip irrigation instead of flood
irrigation.
•	 Drench the affected and sourrounding
plants with a combination of Metalaxyl
35% WP (Apron) @ 1 gm/ltr +
Carbendazim 50% WP (Bavistin /
GLSTIN) @ 2 gm/ltr + Chlorpyriphos
20% EC (Dursban) @ 2 ml/ltr + Phyton-T
@ 5 ml/ltr.
•	 For Papaya, drench with 2 - 4 ltr/plant.
•	 For Ginger, drench with 1 - 2 ltr/plant.
•	 Repeat the drenching twice at intervals of
15-20 days.
•	 Drenching of the affected and surrounding
plants is enough.</p>

<h5>WHITE RUST/WHITE BLISTERS OF CRUCIFERS</h5>
<p>Hosts: Cabbage, Cauliflower, Radish, Mustard, Rapeseed, Broccoli, etc.
Causal Organism: Albugo candida
Distribution: Worldwide</p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Initially chlorotic spots and lesions develop
on leaves and stems.
•	 Infected leaves on their undersides develop
white or creamy pustules/blisters of various
sizes and shapes.
•	 Several such pustules may coalesce to form
large patches.
•	 When young stems and inflorescences are
attacked, the pathogen grows systemically
stimulating various types of deformities
of which hypertrophy (stagheads) is most
pronounced.
•	 Inflorescence axis and peduncles of flowers
become enormously thickened due to
hypertrophy.
•	 The floral parts also become thick and show
various discoloration and malformation.
•	 Quality and yield of the produce will be
greatly reduced under severe conditions.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 The mycelium is intercellular with several
knob-like haustoria in a single host cell.
•	 A dense mass of hyphae collected beneath
the epidermis produces sporangiophores in
pustules/sori.
•	 Sporangiophores are short, club-shaped
Sporulation on stem
and thick towards their bases producing
sporangia.
•	 Sporangia are hyaline, nearly spherical
measuring 14-16 x×16-20 µm.
•	 Each sporangia germinates usually to
produce 4-8 bilfagellate zoospores.</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>•	 The oospores present in plant debris or soils
serve as primary source of inoculum.
•	 Moist, cool weather favours disease
development.
•	 Under optimum conditions of temperatures
between 16 - 250 C and high relative humidity,
the sporangia germinate to produce infective
zoospores.
•	 In the presence of free moisture on leaf
surface, the zoospores enter leaves to cause
infections and spread the disease.
•	 Under unfavorable conditions or at the end
of growing season, the pathogen undergoes
sexual reproduction to produce oospores.
•	 Oospores may also infect hosts or may
survive for long periods of time in soil or
infected plant debris.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Use disease free seeds.
•	 Grow resistant varieties, if available.
•	 Rotate crop with non-hosts.
•	 Remove and destroy infected plant parts.
•	 Plant crops during drier seasons, to reduce
disease incidence and spread.
•	 Spray Fungicides like
o	 Fenamidone + Mancozeb 10% + 50 %
WG (Sectin) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Dimethomorph 50% WP (Acrobat) @
1.25 gm/ltr. or
o	 Famoxadone + Cymoxanil 16.6% +
22.1% SC (Equation Pro) @ 1 ml/ltr. or
o	 Iprovalicarb + Propineb 5.5% + 62.1%
WP (Melody duo) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Cymoxanil + Mancozeb 8% + 64 %
WP (Curzate) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Mancozeb + Mefenoxam 64% + 8 %
WP (Ridomil Gold) @ 3 gm/ltr. or
o Metalaxyl + Mancozeb 8% + 64 %
WP (Master/Matco) @ 3 gm/ltr.
•	 Use Phyton-T along with any of the above
mentioned fungicides for effective control
of the disease and rejuvenation of the
affected plants.
•	 Repeat the spray 2 - 3 times at 7 - 8 days
intervals to completely control the disease.
•	 Change the fungicides and spray if the
problem persists.</p>
