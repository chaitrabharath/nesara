<h2>Diseases</h2>
<h3>Fungal Diseases</h3>
<p>•	 Fungi are small, generally microscopic,
eukaryotic, usually filamentous, branched,
spore-bearing organisms.
•	 They lack chlorophyll.
•	 Fungi have cell walls that contain chitin and
glucans (but no cellulose) as the skeletal
components.
•	 These are embedded in a matrix of
polysaccharides and glycoproteins.
•	 Most of the more than 100,000 known
fungus species are strictly saprophytes, i.e.,
they live on dead organic matter, which they
help decompose.
•	 About 50 species are known to cause disease
in humans, and about as many to cause
diseases in animals, mostly afflicting the skin
or its appendages.
•	 All plants are attacked by some kinds of
fungi, and several parasitic fungi can affect
one or many kinds of plants.
•	 More than 10,000 species of fungi can cause
diseases in plants.
•	 Some fungi can grow and multiply only
by remaining, during their entire life, in
association with their host plants and they
are called obligate parasites or biotrophs.
•	 Others, which require the host plants for a
part of their life cycles, but can complete their cycles on dead organic matter, or grow and
multiply on dead organic matter as well as
on living plants, are known as non-obligate
parasites.
•	 Depending on whether they are primarily
parasites or saprophytes, the non-obligate
parasites are called facultative saprophytes
or facultative parasites.</p>

<h5>Somatic structure</h5>
<p>Some lower forms of fungi, such as Chytrids,
are non-mycelial, unicellular, where the entire
thallus is differentiated into a reproductive
sporangium (Holocarpic).
•	 Most true fungi are composed of filamentous,
branched mycelium, where the thallus is
differentiated into vegetative and reproductive
regions (Eucarpic).
•	 Individual tubular branches of the mycelium
are called hyphae, which are usually 1 - 2 um
in diameter and grow only at the tips.
•	 In the infected plants tissues, the hyphae
are intercellular either with or without
slender projections called haustoria, which
penetrate the host cells and absorb nutrition.
•	 The hyphae may or may not be partitioned
by cross walls.
•	 In endobiotic slime molds, the thallus is a
plasmodium i.e. a naked mass of protoplasm
with all organelles, but without cell wall.</p>

<h5>REPRODUCTION: Asexual and
Sexual spores</h5>
<p>Fungi reproduce by means of spores, which
are formed asexually or as a product of sexual
reproduction.
•	 Asexual spores are produced either inside a
sac-like structure called the sporangium or
on specialized hyphae called conidiophores,
and they exhibit enormous variation in their
structure, shape and size.
•	 The spores produced inside the sporangium
are called sporangiospores, and those
produced on conidiophores are called
conidia.
•	 Sporangiospores when motile by means of
flagella are called zoospores, and the nonmotile ones are called aplanospores.
•	 Conidiophores may rise directly on the
mycelium or develop in walled structures like
the pycnidia, acerevuli, etc.
•	 In downy mildew fungi, sporangia develop at
the tips of ultimate branches of specialized
hyphae branched in various ways, known as
sporangiophores.
•	 In some fungi, terminal or intercalary cells
enlarge and form thick walled spores called
chlamydospores.
•	 Sexual or perfect-state spores developed as
product of sexual reproduction.
•	 Two cells (gametes) of similar size and
appearance (isogamous coenogametangia)
unite and produce sexual spore called
zygospores in Zygomycetes.
•	 In Chytridiomycetes, the gametes are motile
and fuse to form meisosporangia.
•	 There are fungi that do not produce definite
gametes, but produce spores by the union
between two compatible mycelia.
•	 Among higher fungi (Ascomycetes and
Basidiomycetes), the perfect-state spores
are produced after meiosis and hence called
meiospores.
•	 Meiospores in Ascomycetes are called
ascospores, since they are produced inside
a sac-like structure, the ascus.
•	 Whereas they are called basidiospores in
Basidiomycetes, because they are produced
externally on club–like structure, the
basidium.
•	 Deuteromycetes, lack true sexual
reproduction and multiply only by means of
asexual spores.</p>

<h5>Survival, Dissemination and
Spread</h5>
<p>•	 Plant pathogenic fungi and fungi like
organisms (FLOs) spend a part of their life
cycle outside their host plants for different
durations, either in the soil or in plant debris.
•	 These broadly belong to three general
groups differing from each other in respect
of the mode of survival when they are not
parasitically active in their host plants. </p>

<h5>Group-1: Obligate parasites or biotrophs</h5>
<p>•	 These are highly specialized parasites, which
include pathogens like white rusts, downy
mildews, powdery mildews, rusts and smuts.
•	 They spend practically their entire life cycle
on their host plants, and only their thickwalled spores (oospores, teliospores) or
fruit bodies (ascocarps) may fall onto land or
get embedded in plant residues in the soil.
•	 These spores and ascocarps serve as the
chief means of survival.
•	 They remain inactive until the next season
when they produce primary inoculum on
germination.
•	 This inoculum is carried to the susceptible
host, which it infects and begins to grow and
multiply.</p>

<h5>Group-2: Nectotrophs</h5>
<p>•	 This group includes unspecialized parasites
represented by a range of parasites with a
wide host range.
•	 Unlike the highly specialized fungi, theses
fungal pathogens are necrotrophs and are
able to live as saprophytes in the soil.
•	 They grow parasitically on the host plants,
continue to live, grow and multiply on the
dead tissues of the host after its death and
may even further move out of the host debris
into the soil or other decaying plant materials
on which they grow and multiply as strict
saprophytes.
•	 These are potential root infecting soil fungi.
•	 In most cases, the dead plant matter
colonized by them need not be related to the
host parasitized by them.
•	 However, some like Gaeumannomyces
graminis are able to survive in soil only
as long as their host residue persists as a
substrate for their saprophytic existence.
•	 They are also referred to as facultative
saprophytes.
•	 Other root-infecting fungi in this group
include Pythium spp., Fusarium spp,
Verticillium spp., Macrophomina phaseolina
and many others, which are referred to as
soil inhabitants.
•	 They can live in soil as saprophytes for 5 to
6 years in absence of their hosts.</p>

<h5>Group-3: Intermediate parasites</h5>
<p>•	 This group consists of intermediate parasites,
which pass part of their cycles on the host
as parasites and part on dead tissues of the
same host on the ground as saprophytes in
order to complete their life cycle in nature.
•	 These are also necrotrophs.
•	 The group includes pathogens like Venturia
inaequalis (apple scab fungus), Taphrina
deformans (peach leaf curl fungus) and
Claviceps purpurea (ergot of cereals).
•	 They cannot survive freely as saprophytes in
soil.
•	 Unlike the soil invaders which kill their host
tissues in advance, they invade and kill their
host tissues in order to complete a part of
their life cycle.
•	 They also do not grow and multiply on dead
tissues of their hosts, as the soil invaders do,
but they simply complete a part of their life
cycle on dead host tissues.</p>

<h5>Dissemination and spread:</h5>
<p>•	 In zoosporic fungi (Chytridiomycetes) and
FLOs (Oomycetes) zoospores are the means
of dissemination of primary inoculum and
spread of the disease from plant to plant in
the field.
•	 The zoospores can move for only short
distances.
•	 Majority of the fungal pathogens, however
depend for their spread from plant to plant
and to different parts of the same plant on
agents such as wind, water, rain splash, birds,
insects and other animals, and humans.
•	 Among the agents of dissemination, wind
perhaps is the most important for spores of
most fungi and it carries spores over great
distances.
•	 They are disseminated primarily in the
form of enormous variety of their spores,
produced in different ways in different kinds
of fruiting structures.
•	 Spore dissemination in fungi is mostly
passive, though initial discharge of spores in
some fungi is forcible.
•	 In specific cases, water or insects may play
a much important role than wind in spore
dissemination.</p>
<h5>Sexual Spores</h5>
<p>•	 Produced once at the end of the life cycle
of the host.
•	 Produced in smaller numbers, thick walled
and long live.
•	 Overwinter - ensure the survival of the
species by virtue of their capacity to tide
over the unfavorable seasons.
•	 Products of meiosis.
•	 Play a major role in survival and evolution
of the species.</p>

<h5>Asexual spores</h5>
<p>•	 Produced many times within the crop cycle
of the host.
•	 Produced in enormous quantities, light and
short lived.
•	 Do not overwinter - no role in continuity of
species.
•	 Not products of meiosis and hence no role
in evolution of a species.
•	 Play a major role in spread of the disease.</p>

<p>•	 In addition to sexual spores, scelorotia and other resting spores (chlamydospores, etc.) are also
produced to overwinter or oversummer under adverse conditions.
•	 These kind of spores are like a match sticks that can store the fire.
•	 The asexual spores are like the many torches that a matchstick can ignite to spread the fire.
•	 They are produced in abundance under favorable conditions, but very short-lived.
•	 They are produced in many cycles during the crop season and their role is only to spread the
disease in a short span of time.</p>

<h4>ANTHRACNOSE CAUSED BY COLLETOTRICHUM SPP.</h4>
<p>Hosts: Hot and Sweet Pepper, Beans, Black pepper, Cucurbits, Tobacco, Grapes, Banana, etc.
Causal Organisms: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. capsici, C. lindemuthianum,
C. orbiculare, C. musae, C. tabacum, Elsinoe ampelina.</p>

<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Anthracnose is a group of diseases that
appear as dark, sunken lesions on leaves,
stems, flowers and fruits.
•	 Colletotrichum leaf spots are very common
in plant nurseries.
•	 The fungus infects tender leaves, mostly at
the leaf tip region.
•	 Spots are small, brown in color and are
surrounded by a yellow halo.
•	 Later the small circular spots coalesce to form
large elliptical spots on fruits and leaves.
•	 Under severe conditions, defoliation of
affected plants occurs.
•	 The disease is characterized by theappearance of small white/brown/black
circular spots on the leaves and skin of the
fruits that spread in the direction of the long
axis, thus becoming more or less elliptical.
•	 As the infection progresses, the spots get
either diffused and black, greenish or dirty
grey in color or they are markedly delimited
by a thick and sharp black outline enclosing
a lighter black colored area.
•	 The disease has been observed to occur in
three phases, they are:
 i. Seedling blight or Damping-off,
 ii. Leaf spot and die back, and
 iii. Anthracnose or fruit rot</p>

 <h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
 <p>•	 There are many species of Colletotrichum,
which cause anthracnose in many important
vegetable and horticultural crops.
•	 Colletotrichum gloeosporioides forms onecelled, hyaline, cylindrical conidia, with
obtuse ends, measuring 2.7 - 5.0 x 11.1 -
18.5 µm.
•	 It rarely produces setae.
•	 Colletotrichum capsici forms sickle-shaped
conidia, which measure 2.7 - 4.8 x 11.5 -
25.0µm.
•	 This species does not form sclerotia, but
produces abundant setae.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Use disease free seeds as this is a highly
seed-borne and seed transmitted disease.
•	 Treat seeds with Carbendazim 50% WP (2
- 3 gm/kg seed).
•	 Remove and destroy diseased plant parts to
check the spread of the disease.
•	 Avoid sprinkler irrigation.
•	 Instead use drip irrigation as it helps in
restricting spread of the disease.
•	 Improve drainage in the field and keep it free
from infected plant debris.
•	 Spray any of the systemic fungicides like
o Carbendazim 50% WP (Bavistin/
GLSTIN) @1 gm/ltr. or
o Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP (Roak/
Spring/Topsin M) @1 gm/ltr. or
o Propiconazole 25% EC (Tilt) @ 1 ml/
ltr. or
o Difenoconazole 25% EC (Score) at 1
ml/ltr. or
•	 The following broad spectrum contact fungicides
may also be sprayed
o Chlorothalonil 75% WP (Kavach/
Jatayu) @ 2 gm/ltr.
o Mancozeb 75% WP (Dithane M-45) @
2 gm/ltr.
•	 Repeat the spray 2 - 3 times at 7 - 8 days
intervals to completely control the disease.
•	 Change the fungicides and spray if the
problem persists.</p>

<h5>BLAST DISEASE</h5>
<p>Hosts: Rice, Ragi and Pearl millet
Causal organism: Pyricularia oryzae (Rice), P. grisea (Ragi and Pearl millet)</p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Mainly a leaf disease and typical symptoms
appear on leaves, leaf sheath, rachis, nodes
and glumes.
•	 The lesions on leaves appear as small,
bluish, water-soaked flecks of about 1 - 3
mm in diameter.
•	 These lesions rapidly enlarge, become several
centimeters broad and spindle shaped.
•	 The center of the spots appears pale green
or dull greyish green changing to grey, and
the periphery has a dark brown band with a
yellow halo around the lesion.
•	 Lesions may kill the entire leaf in susceptible
varieties, but they remain as minute, pinhead sized brown specks in resistant one.
•	 Infection of other parts of the shoot can
occur at the leaf collar, at the culm and culm
nodes and often at the panicle neck node.
•	 Collar infection can kill the entire leaf blade.
•	 Infection of the panicle neck node, called
neck blast is the most destructive symptom.
•	 The disease is seed-brone and seed
transmitted.
•	 Hence, the disease can occur from the
seedling stage itself.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 Pyricularia grisea is the cause of Rice, Ragi
and Pearl millet blast.
•	 The name P. oryzae has been widely used in
literature, but for the fungus attacking Rice, P.
oryzae is morphologically indistinguishable
from P. grisea which attacks Ragi, Pearl
millet and other grasses.
•	 The perfect state is an ascomycete,
Magnaporthe grisea.
•	 The mycelium is intercellular; the hyphae
are septate, branched, uni- to multinucleate,
hyaline to olivaceous.
•	 Conidiophores are simple or rarely branched,
2 - 4 septate, single or in fascicles emerging
through stomata, olive to fuliginous, swollen
at base, tapering towards lighter colored tip.
•	 A single conidium develops at the tip of each
conidiophore.
•	 Conidia are pyriform (pear shaped) to
obclavate, lightly pigmented, mostly 2
septate, rarely 1 - 3 septate and measure
19.2 - 27.3 x 8.7 - 10.3 µm, with a distinctly
protruding basal hilum</p>
<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Use resistant varieties.
•	 Use disease free seed.
•	 Treat the seeds with Carbendazim 50%
WP (Bavistin/ GLSTIN) @ 4 gm/kg seed.
•	 Give a fungicidal spray before planting.
•	 Use balanced nutrition as high Nitrogen
dose increases the susceptibility to
blast.
•	 Spray any of the following systemic fungicides
2 - 3 times during the crop season.
o Carbendazim 50% WP (Bavistin/
GLSTIN) @1 gm/ltr. or
o Tricyclazole 75% WP (Baan, Beam,
Blastogan) @ 1 gm/ltr.
</p>

<h5>GUMMY STEM BLIGHT</h5>
<p>Hosts: Bottle gourd, Ash gourd, Pumpkin, Musk melons, Cucumbers and Watermelons
Causal organism: Didymella bryoniae
Distribution: Temperate regions of the world. </p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 During the initial stage, the symptoms appear
as pale brown or grey spots on leaves,
petioles and stems.
•	 Leaf spots are circular and grayish green
changing to dark brown.
•	 Diseased leaves are killed and small black
spots (pycnidia) appear on affected leaves. 
•	 Sap may exude from the nodal tissues and
then dry to form lesions, which exude drops
of resin coloured gum.
•	 These lesions expand to the main stem
which leads to wilting of plant.
•	 The lesions may also appear as small,
circular, dark green, water-soaked areas on
fruits.</p>
