<h2>Diseases</h2>
<h3>Fungal Diseases</h3>
<p>•	 Fungi are small, generally microscopic,
eukaryotic, usually filamentous, branched,
spore-bearing organisms.
•	 They lack chlorophyll.
•	 Fungi have cell walls that contain chitin and
glucans (but no cellulose) as the skeletal
components.
•	 These are embedded in a matrix of
polysaccharides and glycoproteins.
•	 Most of the more than 100,000 known
fungus species are strictly saprophytes, i.e.,
they live on dead organic matter, which they
help decompose.
•	 About 50 species are known to cause disease
in humans, and about as many to cause
diseases in animals, mostly afflicting the skin
or its appendages.
•	 All plants are attacked by some kinds of
fungi, and several parasitic fungi can affect
one or many kinds of plants.
•	 More than 10,000 species of fungi can cause
diseases in plants.
•	 Some fungi can grow and multiply only
by remaining, during their entire life, in
association with their host plants and they
are called obligate parasites or biotrophs.
•	 Others, which require the host plants for a
part of their life cycles, but can complete their cycles on dead organic matter, or grow and
multiply on dead organic matter as well as
on living plants, are known as non-obligate
parasites.
•	 Depending on whether they are primarily
parasites or saprophytes, the non-obligate
parasites are called facultative saprophytes
or facultative parasites.</p>

<h5>Somatic structure</h5>
<p>Some lower forms of fungi, such as Chytrids,
are non-mycelial, unicellular, where the entire
thallus is differentiated into a reproductive
sporangium (Holocarpic).
•	 Most true fungi are composed of filamentous,
branched mycelium, where the thallus is
differentiated into vegetative and reproductive
regions (Eucarpic).
•	 Individual tubular branches of the mycelium
are called hyphae, which are usually 1 - 2 um
in diameter and grow only at the tips.
•	 In the infected plants tissues, the hyphae
are intercellular either with or without
slender projections called haustoria, which
penetrate the host cells and absorb nutrition.
•	 The hyphae may or may not be partitioned
by cross walls.
•	 In endobiotic slime molds, the thallus is a
plasmodium i.e. a naked mass of protoplasm
with all organelles, but without cell wall.</p>

<h5>REPRODUCTION: Asexual and
Sexual spores</h5>
<p>Fungi reproduce by means of spores, which
are formed asexually or as a product of sexual
reproduction.
•	 Asexual spores are produced either inside a
sac-like structure called the sporangium or
on specialized hyphae called conidiophores,
and they exhibit enormous variation in their
structure, shape and size.
•	 The spores produced inside the sporangium
are called sporangiospores, and those
produced on conidiophores are called
conidia.
•	 Sporangiospores when motile by means of
flagella are called zoospores, and the nonmotile ones are called aplanospores.
•	 Conidiophores may rise directly on the
mycelium or develop in walled structures like
the pycnidia, acerevuli, etc.
•	 In downy mildew fungi, sporangia develop at
the tips of ultimate branches of specialized
hyphae branched in various ways, known as
sporangiophores.
•	 In some fungi, terminal or intercalary cells
enlarge and form thick walled spores called
chlamydospores.
•	 Sexual or perfect-state spores developed as
product of sexual reproduction.
•	 Two cells (gametes) of similar size and
appearance (isogamous coenogametangia)
unite and produce sexual spore called
zygospores in Zygomycetes.
•	 In Chytridiomycetes, the gametes are motile
and fuse to form meisosporangia.
•	 There are fungi that do not produce definite
gametes, but produce spores by the union
between two compatible mycelia.
•	 Among higher fungi (Ascomycetes and
Basidiomycetes), the perfect-state spores
are produced after meiosis and hence called
meiospores.
•	 Meiospores in Ascomycetes are called
ascospores, since they are produced inside
a sac-like structure, the ascus.
•	 Whereas they are called basidiospores in
Basidiomycetes, because they are produced
externally on club–like structure, the
basidium.
•	 Deuteromycetes, lack true sexual
reproduction and multiply only by means of
asexual spores.</p>

<h5>Survival, Dissemination and
Spread</h5>
<p>•	 Plant pathogenic fungi and fungi like
organisms (FLOs) spend a part of their life
cycle outside their host plants for different
durations, either in the soil or in plant debris.
•	 These broadly belong to three general
groups differing from each other in respect
of the mode of survival when they are not
parasitically active in their host plants. </p>
<h5>Group-1: Obligate parasites or biotrophs</h5>
<p>•	 These are highly specialized parasites, which
include pathogens like white rusts, downy
mildews, powdery mildews, rusts and smuts.
•	 They spend practically their entire life cycle
on their host plants, and only their thickwalled spores (oospores, teliospores) or
fruit bodies (ascocarps) may fall onto land or
get embedded in plant residues in the soil.
•	 These spores and ascocarps serve as the
chief means of survival.
•	 They remain inactive until the next season
when they produce primary inoculum on
germination.
•	 This inoculum is carried to the susceptible
host, which it infects and begins to grow and
multiply.</p>
