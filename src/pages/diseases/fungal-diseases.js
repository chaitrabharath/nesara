<h2>Diseases</h2>
<h3>Fungal Diseases</h3>
<p>•	 Fungi are small, generally microscopic,
eukaryotic, usually filamentous, branched,
spore-bearing organisms.
•	 They lack chlorophyll.
•	 Fungi have cell walls that contain chitin and
glucans (but no cellulose) as the skeletal
components.
•	 These are embedded in a matrix of
polysaccharides and glycoproteins.
•	 Most of the more than 100,000 known
fungus species are strictly saprophytes, i.e.,
they live on dead organic matter, which they
help decompose.
•	 About 50 species are known to cause disease
in humans, and about as many to cause
diseases in animals, mostly afflicting the skin
or its appendages.
•	 All plants are attacked by some kinds of
fungi, and several parasitic fungi can affect
one or many kinds of plants.
•	 More than 10,000 species of fungi can cause
diseases in plants.
•	 Some fungi can grow and multiply only
by remaining, during their entire life, in
association with their host plants and they
are called obligate parasites or biotrophs.
•	 Others, which require the host plants for a
part of their life cycles, but can complete their cycles on dead organic matter, or grow and
multiply on dead organic matter as well as
on living plants, are known as non-obligate
parasites.
•	 Depending on whether they are primarily
parasites or saprophytes, the non-obligate
parasites are called facultative saprophytes
or facultative parasites.</p>

<h5>Somatic structure</h5>
<p>Some lower forms of fungi, such as Chytrids,
are non-mycelial, unicellular, where the entire
thallus is differentiated into a reproductive
sporangium (Holocarpic).
•	 Most true fungi are composed of filamentous,
branched mycelium, where the thallus is
differentiated into vegetative and reproductive
regions (Eucarpic).
•	 Individual tubular branches of the mycelium
are called hyphae, which are usually 1 - 2 um
in diameter and grow only at the tips.
•	 In the infected plants tissues, the hyphae
are intercellular either with or without
slender projections called haustoria, which
penetrate the host cells and absorb nutrition.
•	 The hyphae may or may not be partitioned
by cross walls.
•	 In endobiotic slime molds, the thallus is a
plasmodium i.e. a naked mass of protoplasm
with all organelles, but without cell wall.</p>

<h5>REPRODUCTION: Asexual and
Sexual spores</h5>
<p>Fungi reproduce by means of spores, which
are formed asexually or as a product of sexual
reproduction.
•	 Asexual spores are produced either inside a
sac-like structure called the sporangium or
on specialized hyphae called conidiophores,
and they exhibit enormous variation in their
structure, shape and size.
•	 The spores produced inside the sporangium
are called sporangiospores, and those
produced on conidiophores are called
conidia.
•	 Sporangiospores when motile by means of
flagella are called zoospores, and the nonmotile ones are called aplanospores.
•	 Conidiophores may rise directly on the
mycelium or develop in walled structures like
the pycnidia, acerevuli, etc.
•	 In downy mildew fungi, sporangia develop at
the tips of ultimate branches of specialized
hyphae branched in various ways, known as
sporangiophores.
•	 In some fungi, terminal or intercalary cells
enlarge and form thick walled spores called
chlamydospores.
•	 Sexual or perfect-state spores developed as
product of sexual reproduction.
•	 Two cells (gametes) of similar size and
appearance (isogamous coenogametangia)
unite and produce sexual spore called
zygospores in Zygomycetes.
•	 In Chytridiomycetes, the gametes are motile
and fuse to form meisosporangia.
•	 There are fungi that do not produce definite
gametes, but produce spores by the union
between two compatible mycelia.
•	 Among higher fungi (Ascomycetes and
Basidiomycetes), the perfect-state spores
are produced after meiosis and hence called
meiospores.
•	 Meiospores in Ascomycetes are called
ascospores, since they are produced inside
a sac-like structure, the ascus.
•	 Whereas they are called basidiospores in
Basidiomycetes, because they are produced
externally on club–like structure, the
basidium.
•	 Deuteromycetes, lack true sexual
reproduction and multiply only by means of
asexual spores.</p>

<h5>Survival, Dissemination and
Spread</h5>
<p>•	 Plant pathogenic fungi and fungi like
organisms (FLOs) spend a part of their life
cycle outside their host plants for different
durations, either in the soil or in plant debris.
•	 These broadly belong to three general
groups differing from each other in respect
of the mode of survival when they are not
parasitically active in their host plants. </p>

<h5>Group-1: Obligate parasites or biotrophs</h5>
<p>•	 These are highly specialized parasites, which
include pathogens like white rusts, downy
mildews, powdery mildews, rusts and smuts.
•	 They spend practically their entire life cycle
on their host plants, and only their thickwalled spores (oospores, teliospores) or
fruit bodies (ascocarps) may fall onto land or
get embedded in plant residues in the soil.
•	 These spores and ascocarps serve as the
chief means of survival.
•	 They remain inactive until the next season
when they produce primary inoculum on
germination.
•	 This inoculum is carried to the susceptible
host, which it infects and begins to grow and
multiply.</p>

<h5>Group-2: Nectotrophs</h5>
<p>•	 This group includes unspecialized parasites
represented by a range of parasites with a
wide host range.
•	 Unlike the highly specialized fungi, theses
fungal pathogens are necrotrophs and are
able to live as saprophytes in the soil.
•	 They grow parasitically on the host plants,
continue to live, grow and multiply on the
dead tissues of the host after its death and
may even further move out of the host debris
into the soil or other decaying plant materials
on which they grow and multiply as strict
saprophytes.
•	 These are potential root infecting soil fungi.
•	 In most cases, the dead plant matter
colonized by them need not be related to the
host parasitized by them.
•	 However, some like Gaeumannomyces
graminis are able to survive in soil only
as long as their host residue persists as a
substrate for their saprophytic existence.
•	 They are also referred to as facultative
saprophytes.
•	 Other root-infecting fungi in this group
include Pythium spp., Fusarium spp,
Verticillium spp., Macrophomina phaseolina
and many others, which are referred to as
soil inhabitants.
•	 They can live in soil as saprophytes for 5 to
6 years in absence of their hosts.</p>

<h5>Group-3: Intermediate parasites</h5>
<p>•	 This group consists of intermediate parasites,
which pass part of their cycles on the host
as parasites and part on dead tissues of the
same host on the ground as saprophytes in
order to complete their life cycle in nature.
•	 These are also necrotrophs.
•	 The group includes pathogens like Venturia
inaequalis (apple scab fungus), Taphrina
deformans (peach leaf curl fungus) and
Claviceps purpurea (ergot of cereals).
•	 They cannot survive freely as saprophytes in
soil.
•	 Unlike the soil invaders which kill their host
tissues in advance, they invade and kill their
host tissues in order to complete a part of
their life cycle.
•	 They also do not grow and multiply on dead
tissues of their hosts, as the soil invaders do,
but they simply complete a part of their life
cycle on dead host tissues.</p>

<h5>Dissemination and spread:</h5>
<p>•	 In zoosporic fungi (Chytridiomycetes) and
FLOs (Oomycetes) zoospores are the means
of dissemination of primary inoculum and
spread of the disease from plant to plant in
the field.
•	 The zoospores can move for only short
distances.
•	 Majority of the fungal pathogens, however
depend for their spread from plant to plant
and to different parts of the same plant on
agents such as wind, water, rain splash, birds,
insects and other animals, and humans.
•	 Among the agents of dissemination, wind
perhaps is the most important for spores of
most fungi and it carries spores over great
distances.
•	 They are disseminated primarily in the
form of enormous variety of their spores,
produced in different ways in different kinds
of fruiting structures.
•	 Spore dissemination in fungi is mostly
passive, though initial discharge of spores in
some fungi is forcible.
•	 In specific cases, water or insects may play
a much important role than wind in spore
dissemination.</p>
<h5>Sexual Spores</h5>
<p>•	 Produced once at the end of the life cycle
of the host.
•	 Produced in smaller numbers, thick walled
and long live.
•	 Overwinter - ensure the survival of the
species by virtue of their capacity to tide
over the unfavorable seasons.
•	 Products of meiosis.
•	 Play a major role in survival and evolution
of the species.</p>

<h5>Asexual spores</h5>
<p>•	 Produced many times within the crop cycle
of the host.
•	 Produced in enormous quantities, light and
short lived.
•	 Do not overwinter - no role in continuity of
species.
•	 Not products of meiosis and hence no role
in evolution of a species.
•	 Play a major role in spread of the disease.</p>

<p>•	 In addition to sexual spores, scelorotia and other resting spores (chlamydospores, etc.) are also
produced to overwinter or oversummer under adverse conditions.
•	 These kind of spores are like a match sticks that can store the fire.
•	 The asexual spores are like the many torches that a matchstick can ignite to spread the fire.
•	 They are produced in abundance under favorable conditions, but very short-lived.
•	 They are produced in many cycles during the crop season and their role is only to spread the
disease in a short span of time.</p>

<h4>ANTHRACNOSE CAUSED BY COLLETOTRICHUM SPP.</h4>
<p>Hosts: Hot and Sweet Pepper, Beans, Black pepper, Cucurbits, Tobacco, Grapes, Banana, etc.
Causal Organisms: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. capsici, C. lindemuthianum,
C. orbiculare, C. musae, C. tabacum, Elsinoe ampelina.</p>

<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Anthracnose is a group of diseases that
appear as dark, sunken lesions on leaves,
stems, flowers and fruits.
•	 Colletotrichum leaf spots are very common
in plant nurseries.
•	 The fungus infects tender leaves, mostly at
the leaf tip region.
•	 Spots are small, brown in color and are
surrounded by a yellow halo.
•	 Later the small circular spots coalesce to form
large elliptical spots on fruits and leaves.
•	 Under severe conditions, defoliation of
affected plants occurs.
•	 The disease is characterized by theappearance of small white/brown/black
circular spots on the leaves and skin of the
fruits that spread in the direction of the long
axis, thus becoming more or less elliptical.
•	 As the infection progresses, the spots get
either diffused and black, greenish or dirty
grey in color or they are markedly delimited
by a thick and sharp black outline enclosing
a lighter black colored area.
•	 The disease has been observed to occur in
three phases, they are:
 i. Seedling blight or Damping-off,
 ii. Leaf spot and die back, and
 iii. Anthracnose or fruit rot</p>

 <h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
 <p>•	 There are many species of Colletotrichum,
which cause anthracnose in many important
vegetable and horticultural crops.
•	 Colletotrichum gloeosporioides forms onecelled, hyaline, cylindrical conidia, with
obtuse ends, measuring 2.7 - 5.0 x 11.1 -
18.5 µm.
•	 It rarely produces setae.
•	 Colletotrichum capsici forms sickle-shaped
conidia, which measure 2.7 - 4.8 x 11.5 -
25.0µm.
•	 This species does not form sclerotia, but
produces abundant setae.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Use disease free seeds as this is a highly
seed-borne and seed transmitted disease.
•	 Treat seeds with Carbendazim 50% WP (2
- 3 gm/kg seed).
•	 Remove and destroy diseased plant parts to
check the spread of the disease.
•	 Avoid sprinkler irrigation.
•	 Instead use drip irrigation as it helps in
restricting spread of the disease.
•	 Improve drainage in the field and keep it free
from infected plant debris.
•	 Spray any of the systemic fungicides like
o Carbendazim 50% WP (Bavistin/
GLSTIN) @1 gm/ltr. or
o Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP (Roak/
Spring/Topsin M) @1 gm/ltr. or
o Propiconazole 25% EC (Tilt) @ 1 ml/
ltr. or
o Difenoconazole 25% EC (Score) at 1
ml/ltr. or
•	 The following broad spectrum contact fungicides
may also be sprayed
o Chlorothalonil 75% WP (Kavach/
Jatayu) @ 2 gm/ltr.
o Mancozeb 75% WP (Dithane M-45) @
2 gm/ltr.
•	 Repeat the spray 2 - 3 times at 7 - 8 days
intervals to completely control the disease.
•	 Change the fungicides and spray if the
problem persists.</p>

<h5>BLAST DISEASE</h5>
<p>Hosts: Rice, Ragi and Pearl millet
Causal organism: Pyricularia oryzae (Rice), P. grisea (Ragi and Pearl millet)</p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Mainly a leaf disease and typical symptoms
appear on leaves, leaf sheath, rachis, nodes
and glumes.
•	 The lesions on leaves appear as small,
bluish, water-soaked flecks of about 1 - 3
mm in diameter.
•	 These lesions rapidly enlarge, become several
centimeters broad and spindle shaped.
•	 The center of the spots appears pale green
or dull greyish green changing to grey, and
the periphery has a dark brown band with a
yellow halo around the lesion.
•	 Lesions may kill the entire leaf in susceptible
varieties, but they remain as minute, pinhead sized brown specks in resistant one.
•	 Infection of other parts of the shoot can
occur at the leaf collar, at the culm and culm
nodes and often at the panicle neck node.
•	 Collar infection can kill the entire leaf blade.
•	 Infection of the panicle neck node, called
neck blast is the most destructive symptom.
•	 The disease is seed-brone and seed
transmitted.
•	 Hence, the disease can occur from the
seedling stage itself.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 Pyricularia grisea is the cause of Rice, Ragi
and Pearl millet blast.
•	 The name P. oryzae has been widely used in
literature, but for the fungus attacking Rice, P.
oryzae is morphologically indistinguishable
from P. grisea which attacks Ragi, Pearl
millet and other grasses.
•	 The perfect state is an ascomycete,
Magnaporthe grisea.
•	 The mycelium is intercellular; the hyphae
are septate, branched, uni- to multinucleate,
hyaline to olivaceous.
•	 Conidiophores are simple or rarely branched,
2 - 4 septate, single or in fascicles emerging
through stomata, olive to fuliginous, swollen
at base, tapering towards lighter colored tip.
•	 A single conidium develops at the tip of each
conidiophore.
•	 Conidia are pyriform (pear shaped) to
obclavate, lightly pigmented, mostly 2
septate, rarely 1 - 3 septate and measure
19.2 - 27.3 x 8.7 - 10.3 µm, with a distinctly
protruding basal hilum</p>
<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Use resistant varieties.
•	 Use disease free seed.
•	 Treat the seeds with Carbendazim 50%
WP (Bavistin/ GLSTIN) @ 4 gm/kg seed.
•	 Give a fungicidal spray before planting.
•	 Use balanced nutrition as high Nitrogen
dose increases the susceptibility to
blast.
•	 Spray any of the following systemic fungicides
2 - 3 times during the crop season.
o Carbendazim 50% WP (Bavistin/
GLSTIN) @1 gm/ltr. or
o Tricyclazole 75% WP (Baan, Beam,
Blastogan) @ 1 gm/ltr.
</p>

<h5>GUMMY STEM BLIGHT</h5>
<p>Hosts: Bottle gourd, Ash gourd, Pumpkin, Musk melons, Cucumbers and Watermelons
Causal organism: Didymella bryoniae
Distribution: Temperate regions of the world. </p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 During the initial stage, the symptoms appear
as pale brown or grey spots on leaves,
petioles and stems.
•	 Leaf spots are circular and grayish green
changing to dark brown.
•	 Diseased leaves are killed and small black
spots (pycnidia) appear on affected leaves. 
•	 Sap may exude from the nodal tissues and
then dry to form lesions, which exude drops
of resin coloured gum.
•	 These lesions expand to the main stem
which leads to wilting of plant.
•	 The lesions may also appear as small,
circular, dark green, water-soaked areas on
fruits.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 The conidia are hyaline, cylindrical with
rounded ends, non– or monoseptate, and 6
- 13 µm long.
•	 The dark pseudothecia, 125 - 213 µm in
diameter, may also form especially on stems.
•	 The numerous bitunicate asci usually produce
8 ascospores per ascus.</p>
<p>•	 The ascospores are 14 - 18 x 4 - 6 µm,
hyaline, monoseptate with a constriction at
the septum and rounded on ends.
•	 The upper cell is usually wider than the lower
cell.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Use disease free seed.
•	 Treat the seeds with Carbendazim
50% WP (Bavistin) @ 5 gm/kg seed.
•	 Follow phytosanitary measures to reduce the
inoculum load in the field.
•	 Spray the mixture of Carbendazim
50% WP (Bavistin/GLSTIN) @ 2 gm/ltr. +Chlorothalonil 75% WP (Kavach) @ 4 gm/
ltr during the initial stage of the disease.
•	 Smear the affected stem and axils with thick
paste of Carbendazim 50% WP (Bavistin)
@ 10 gm/ltr + Chlorothalonil 75% WP
(Kavach)@ 20 gm/ltr.
•	 The spray and smearing has to be repeated
twice or thRice at the interval of 7 - 8 days</p>

<h5>LEAF SPOTS CAUSED BY CERCOSPORA SPP.</h5>
<p>Hosts: Chilli, Capsicum, Okra, Brinjal, Beans, Tobacco, Cucurbits, Groundnut, Pomegranate,
Rice, Carrot, Beetroot, Banana.
Causal Organisms: Cercospora capsici, C. citrulina, C. canascens, C. cruenta, C. beticola, C.
arachidicola, C. personata, C. nicotianae, C. a belmoschi , C. malayensis, C. solani,
C. carotae, C. punicae, C. janseana (Rice), C. zeae-maydis and Pseudocercospora musae, etc.
Distribution: Warm temperate, subtropical and tropical regions of the world.</p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Disease incidence is high during rainy
seasons and in sprinkler irrigated fields.
•	 Leaf lesions typically are brown and circular
with small to large light contrast and dark
brown margins.
•	 These lesions may enlarge to 1 cm or more
in diameter and coalesce affecting large portions of leaves, which wither and drop
off.
•	 Defoliation in some crops may often be due
to this disease.
•	 Stem, petiole and peduncle lesions also have
elliptical gray centered dark bordered spots.
•	 It is also known as Frog eye spot owing to
its resemblence.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 Many species of Cercospora cause leaf spots
in various crops.
•	 It belongs to phylum Ascomycota.
•	 The organism forms conidia on unbranched
conidiophores, which are straight or curved,
pale brown, 30-80 µm long and 4-6 µm
wide.
•	 Conidial scars are clearly evident on the
conidiophores after conidia have dislodged.
•	 The conidia are several celled, straight or
slightly curved, hyaline, smooth, 40 - 135
µm long and 3 - 5 µm wide.
•	 They are widest at the base and have a
thickened scar at the point of attachment to
the conidiophores. </p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Sanitation is an important tool in disease
management since the fungus can easily
survive in infected leaves that fall and
remain on the ground.
•	 Remove and destroy diseased plant parts to
check the spread of the disease.
•	 Spray any of the Systemic fungicides like
o Carbendazim 50% WP (Bavistin/
GLSTIN) @1 gm/ltr. or
o Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP (Topsin
M) @1 gm/ltr. or
o Propiconazole 25% EC (Tilt) @ 1 ml/
ltr. or
o Difenoconazole 25% EC (Score) at 1
ml/ltr can also be used as both preventive
and curative spray or
•	 The following Broad spectrum contact
fungicides may also be sprayed:
o Chlorothalonil 75% WP (Kavach/
Jatayu) @2 gm/ltr.
o Mancozeb 75% WP (Dithane M-45)
@2 gm/ltr.
•	 Repeat the spray 2-3 times at 7-8 days
interval to completely control the disease.
•	 Change the fungicides and spray if the
problem is severe.</p>

<h5>DISEASES CAUSED BY RHIZOCTONIA SPP.</h5>
<p>•	 Rhizoctonia is a soil-borne plant pathogenic
fungus that belongs to Basidiomycetes group.
•	 With a wide host range and worldwide
distribution, Rhizoctonia causes a variety
of diseases including Damping-off, aerial
blights, stem rot and root rot in almost all
cultivated crops.
•	 Rhizoctonia species do not produce spores,
but are composed of hyphae and sclerotia.
•	 Sclerotia are tough, brownish black structures,
which survive in soil or infected plant tissue
for years.</p>

<h5>Sheath Blight of Paddy and Maize</h5>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Initial symptoms appear on lower leaf sheath
as elliptical or oval to irregular greenish-gray
lesions with purple brown margin at or above
the water line.
•	 The lesions enlarge and the center of the
lesions become pale green surrounded by an
irregular purple brown border, appearing like
snake skin.
•	 Under favorable conditions, infection spreads
rapidly by means of runner hyphae to upper
plant parts and to adjacent plants.
•	 The pathogen produces sclerotia, which are
loosely attached to infected tissue and are
easily dislodged from the plant when mature.
•	 Heavily infected plants produce poorly filled
grains particularly in the lower portion of the
panicle.
•	 The disease is a major production constraint
in profusely tillering high yielding varieties
and hybrids of Rice resulting in 40 - 50%
yield loss.</p>

<h5>WEB BLIGHT OF BEANS</h5>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 The initial symptoms on aerial parts appear
as small, necrotic spots with brown centers
and olive green margins.
•	 These spots become water-soaked, enlarge
and coalesce quickly to give infected plant a
scalded appearance.
•	 Subsequently, the surface of infected plant
parts becomes rapidly covered by whitish to
brown mycelium; sometimes accompanied
by small sclerotia.
•	 Under dry conditions, the necrotic spots
fall from the leaves, resulting in a symptom
known as cock-eye.
•	 On pods, symptoms appear as light brown,
irregular lesions that coalesce and cause
poorly formed or decayed seeds.</p>

<h4>TARGET SPOT AND SORE SHIN IN TOBACCO</h4>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Rhizoctonia solani causes two types of
diseases on Tobacco.
Sore shin
•	 The disease is usually observed at early stages
of seedling growth.
•	 The first symptom is a small water-soaked
lesion on the stem close to the soil line that
rapidly becomes brown and sunken.
•	 Under favorable conditions, lesions become
very constricted and the stems break-off.
•	 The lesions continue to grow throughout the
Earlyl stage of infection (left) advanced stage with typical web formation (right)
stem and leaves causing them to turn brown
and die.
Target spot
•	 The major symptoms are large leaf lesions
with alternating rings of light and dark brown.
•	 Symptoms on leaves begin as small, round,
water-soaked spots about 2-3mm in diameter.
•	 Under favorable conditions, these lesions
enlarge rapidly, becoming light green, almost
transparent, with irregular margins and
chlorotic halos.
•	 In infested areas, lower leaves turn brown
and stick to the surface of the tray and the presence of brown spider-like webs
(mycelium) may be observed on the leaves
and stems.</p>
<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 The most common species of Rhizoctonia is
R. solani with the teleomorph Thanatephorus
cucumeris•	 The mycelium of R. solani is colorless when
young and yellow brown to reddish brown
when mature or in older cultures.
•	 The hyphae are 8 - 12 µm in diameter,
multinucleate, and have prominent dolipore
septa.
•	 The young hyphae typically branch at 450
 or
900
 angles; hyphal branches are constricted
at the point of origin and septate near
constriction.
•	 The pathogen produces sclerotia, which
are irregularly hemispherical, flat bottomed,
white when first formed and later turn brown
or reddish brown.
•	 The pathogen has several anastomosis
groups.</p>
<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>•	 Soil-borne mycelia and sclerotia are the
primary source of inoculum, which survive
in plant debris.
•	 Low sunlight, high humidity (> 95%) and
moderate to high temperatures (28 - 320 C)
favor disease development and spread.
•	 In paddy, the floating sclerotia tend to
accumulate around the plant at the waterplant interface; hence initial infections occur
near the waterline.
•	 Disease develops more rapidly during late
tillering, early heading and grain filling
stages.
•	 The disease is favored by moderate
temperatures, high humidity, and prolonged
periods of leaf wetness.</p>
<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Use resistant varieties, if available.
•	 Use certified/treated seeds.
•	 Avoid dense planting.
•	 Use following fungicides for drenching in
nursery and for spraying:
o Hexaconazole (Contaf plus) @ 2 ml/ltr.
or
o Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP (Roak,
Roko, Spring, Topmast) @ 2 gm/ltr or
o Carbendazim 50% WP (Bavistin) @ 1
gm/ltr.
•	 Repeat the spray twice or thrice at intervals
of 8 - 10 days.</p>

<h4>LEAF SPOTS and BLIGHTS CAUSED BY SPECIES OF
ALTERNARIA SPP</h4>
<p>Hosts: Tomato, Potato, Onion, Brinjal, Carrot, Chilli, Cucurbits, Cabbage, Cauliflower,
 Radish and many others
Causal Organisms: Alternaria solani, A. porri, A. melongenae, A. alternata, A. dauci,
 A. cucumerina, A. brassicae and A. brassicicola and many others.</p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 The fungus attacks foliage causing
characteristic leaf spots and blight.
•	 Symptoms may also occur on stems and
fruits.
•	 Early symptoms appear as irregular, brown
spots and dead areas on older leaves.
•	 These spots typically have concentric, black
Tomato
rings giving an oyster shell, or target board
appearance to the lesions.
•	 Yellow halo surrounds the spots.
•	 Often several spots coalesce to form large
patches, resulting in the leaf blight.
•	 In severe cases the entire foliage is blighted.
•	 Under most favorable conditions (rainy), the
lesions also extend to stems and fruits. </p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 The genus Alternaria is a large and important
group of pathogenic fungi, which cause a
significant number of important diseases.
•	 The mycelium is haploid and septate,
becoming darkly pigmented with age.
•	 The asexual conidia are borne singly or in a
chain of two on distinct conidiophores.
•	 The beaked conidia normally possess 9 – 11
transverse septae in species of A. solani, A.
cucumerina, A. melongenae, etc.
•	 Conidia in Alternaria alternata are borne on
short conidiophores in chains of four to five,
without beak.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Grow resistant varieties, if available.
•	 Rotate crops with non-host crops.
•	 Remove and destroy affected leaves and
twigs from the bottom to minimize the
inoculum load.
•	 Maintain proper spacing between rows and
plants to facilitate easy movement of air to
reduce humidity within the crop.
•	 Do not use sprinklers for irrigation.
•	 Instead use drip irrigation.
•	 Spray any of the contact or broad spectrum
fungicides like
o Mancozeb 75% WP (Dithane M -45/
Indofil M-45) @ 2-3 gm/ltr. or
o Chlorothalonil 75% WP (Kavach or
Jatayu) @ 2 gm/ltr. or
o Propineb 70% WP (Antracol) @ 3 gm/ltr.
or
o Zineb 75% WP (Indofil Z 78) @ 2.5 gm/
ltr. or
o Pyraclostrobin 5%+Metiram 55% WG
(Cabriotop) @ 3 gm/ltr.
•	 Repeat the spray 2-3 times at 7-8 days
intervals to effectively control the disease.
•	 Change the fungicides and spray, if the
problem is severe.</p>

<h4>Leaf Blights Caused by Helminthosporium Spp.</h4>
<p>Hosts: Maize, Sorghum, Rice, Pearl millet, Sugarcane and many others.
Causal Organisms: Species of Helminthosporium, Bipolaris, Drechslera.</p>

<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Long, elliptical, greyish green or tan lesions
measuring from 2.5 cm to 15 cm in length.
•	 These lesions develop first on the lower
leaves, and progress to upper leaves.
•	 Under favourable conditions, susceptible
plants become severely blighted and they
may die prematurely.
•	 Under wet weather conditions large numbers
of greyish black spores are produced on the
lesions. </p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>•	 Disease development is favoured by moderate
temperatures (18 – 27OC) and heavy dews or
cloudy weather during crop season.
•	 It normally does not develop during dry
weather.
•	 The fungus overwinters as mycelia and
conidia in infected plant debris.
•	 Conidia are air-borne and can be carried to
long distances to cause secondary spread. </p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 Conidia of H. turcicum (Exserohilum
turcicum) are olive grey in color, 3-8 septate
and spindle shaped with protruding hilum.
•	 Whereas condia of H. maydis (Bipolaris
maydis) are olivaceous brown, curved, spindle
shaped and tapering to round ends.
•	 Conidia of H. oryzae (Bipolaris oryzae) are
fusoid, obclavate to cyclindrical, generally
curved, light brown to golden brown,
protruding hilum light to dark.
•	 Conidia of H. sacchari are usually curved,
elliptic to elliptic fusiform, tapering towards
rounded ends.
•	 Pale brown to greyish brown, distoseptate,
hilum slightly protruberant.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Most economical and efficient method is to
grow resistant hybrids.
•	 Where practical and economical like in seed
production, spray fungicides like
o Mancozeb 75% WP (Dithane M–45) or
o Chlorothalonil 75% WP (Kavach) @
2gm/ltr starting when lesions are first
observed.
•	 Repeat spray twice at weekly intervals. </p>

<h4>Fungal Wilts and Root Rots</h4>
<p>•	 Root rots and wilts are caused mainly by soilborne pathogens.
•	 These can be broadly classified into those
caused by Oomycetes, Fungi and Bacteria.
•	 Among the Oomycetes, Pythium and
Phytophthora species cause root, rhizome
and tuber rots.
•	 Wilts caused by various fungal species of
Fusarium, Verticillium, Rhizoctonia and
Sclerotium are of great importance.
•	 In addition, bacterial wilt caused by
Pseudomonas (Ralstonia) solanacearum
particularly in solanaceous crops leads to
huge losses.
•	 Soil-borne diseases are very difficult to
control because of presence and build up of
huge inoculum in the soil.
•	 Growing resistant varieties, wherever
available, is the best method to avoid crop
losses.
•	 Resistant varieties are available for Fusarium
and bacterial wilts in a few crop varieties.
•	 However, when resistant varieties are not
available, and if the crop is having good
market value, the diseases may be managed
following cultural and chemical methods. </p>

<h5>WILTS AND ROOT ROTS CAUSED BY FUSARIUM SPP. AND
VERTICILLIUM SPP. (DEUTEROMYCETES)</h5>
<p>Hosts: Tomato, Chilli, Capsicum, Brinjal, Chickpea, Pigeon pea, Potato, Cucurbits, Banana,
 Tobacco, Ginger, Rose, Chrysanthemum and many other crops.
Causal organisms: Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, F. oxysporum f. sp. capsici, F.
oxysporum f. sp.. melongenae, F. oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli, F. oxysporum
f. sp. ciceris, F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis, F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense, F.
oxysporum f. sp. nicotianae, F. avenaceum, F. solani, F. udum, etc.
 Verticillium dahliae, V. albo-atrum.
Distribution: Worldwide </p>

<h5>FUSARIUM WILTS</h5>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Wilt diseases are predominantly soil-borne.
•	 In seedlings, Fusarium wilt causes drooping
and downward curvature of the oldest leaves,
usually followed by wilting and death of the
plant.
•	 The early stage yellowing of the lower leaves
on only one side (partial wilting) of the
stem, and leaflets on one side of the petiole
may be seen.
•	 Older plants in the field are infected at all
stages of growth, but disease generally
becomes most evident when the fruits are
beginning to mature.
•	 The yellowed leaves gradually wilt and die
and yellowing progresses up the stem until
the foliage is killed and the stem dies.
•	 Frequently, a single shoot is killed before the
rest of the plant suffers damage.
•	 The stem of wilted plant shows no soft decay.
•	 When cut length-wise, the woody part next
to the green outer cortex shows dark-brown
discoloration of the water-conducting tissues,
which is characteristic of the disease.</p>

<h5>VERTICILLIUM WILTS</h5>
<p>•	 Symptoms are superficially similar to
Fusarium wilts.
•	 In Verticillium wilt, the infected leaves show
the presence of irregularly scattered pale
yellow necrotic spots on the lamina.
•	 Later on, these spots coalesce resulting in
complete wilting of leaves.
•	 Verticillium wilt disease affects over 350
species of plants.
•	 It is caused by six species of Verticillium.
•	 The two common species are V. dahliae and
V. albo-atrum.
•	 Wilting of stem and leaves occurring due to
the blockage of the xylem vascular tissues
and therefore reduced water and nutrient
flow.
•	 In small plants and seedlings, Verticillium
can kill the plant.
•	 In larger or more developed plants the
severity can vary.
•	 Sometimes only one side of the plant will
appear infected because, being bound to
vascular tissues, the disease moves upward
and not radially.
•	 Other symptoms include stunting, chlorosis
or yellowing of the leaves, necrosis of the
leaf tissue and defoliation.
•	 Internal vascular tissue discoloration can be
seen when the stem is cut.
•	 In contrast to Fusarium wilt, Verticillium wilt
discoloration seldom extends more than 10-
12 inches above the soil, even though its
toxin may progress farther.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 Fusarium and Verticillium belong to
the fungal class Deuteromycetes (Fungi
Imperfecti).
•	 Fusarium oxysporum is an asexual fungus
that produces three types of sporesmicroconidia, macroconidia and
chlamydospores.
•	 Microconidia are aseptate, produced under
all conditions, and produced mostly within
the infected plants.
•	 Macroconidia are three to five celled and are commonly found on the surface of plants.
•	 Chlamydospores are either one or two celled.
•	 The vegetative mycelium is hyaline, septate,
and multinucleate.
•	 The nuclei are haploid in culture.
•	 Conidia are ovoid or ellipsoid and usually
single celled.
•	 They are borne on phialides, which are
specialized hyphae produced in a whorl
around each conidiophore.
•	 Each phialide carries a mass of conidia.
•	 Verticillium is named for this verticillate
(whorled) arrangement of the phialides on
the conidiophore</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>•	 The pathogens inhabit soil in the form of
spores / chlamydospores / sexual resting
spores.
•	 Rain water or irrigation transports infested
soil and fungus spores to uninfested areas of
the field.
•	 Contaminated farm equipment and even the
shoes of workers also spread the disease.
•	 Pythium and Phytophthora (Oomycetes) are
wet pathogens causing decay of the roots in
soils with high moisture level.</p>
<p>•	 Fusarium and Verticillium are dry pathogens,
which block the water conducting tissues,
cause vascular wilts (partial wilts) in warm
and moist sandy soils.
•	 Rhizoctonia and Sclerotium affect the plant
stems near soil-line in well drained sandy
soils with sufficient moisture.
•	 Bacterial vascular pathogens also block the
vascular system, but causing sudden wilting.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Grow resistant varieties, when available.
•	 Rotate crop with Rice, Pearl millet, Ragi and
Sorghum.
•	 Infected materials should not be left in the
field and should be destroyed.
•	 Avoid flood irrigation since it helps in
spreading the disease.
•	 Adopt drip irrigation.
•	 Avoid high doses of nitrogenous fertilizers
(particularly ammonical fertilizers like DAP,
Ammonium Sulphate).
•	 In crops where it is economical, drench the
root zone of affected and surrounding plants
with
o Carbendazim 50% WP (Bavistin) @ 2 gm/ltr + Phyton-T @ 5
ml/ltr or
o Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP
(Roko/Topmast/Carnet) @ 2 - 3 gm/ltr. +
Phyton-T @ 5 ml/ltr @ 200 - 300 ml/ plant
for vegetables, and 2 - 5 litres/plant in
case of Ginger and Banana.
•	 Chlorpyriphos 20% EC @ 2 ml/ltr. can
also be mixed, if there is any damage due to
insects and/or nematodes.
•	 Earthing up of drenched plants helps in early
recovery.
•	 If disease spread continues, repeat the
drenching after 15 - 20 days</p>

<h5>SOUTHERN BLIGHT CAUSED BY SCLEROTIUM ROLFSII</h5>
<p>Hosts: Chilli, Capsicum, Brinjal, Tomato, Cucurbits, Beans, Onion, Rose, Ginger, Chrysanthemum,
Black pepper.
Causal organism: Sclerotium rolfsii
Distribution: Worldwide but most important in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate areas.</p>
<h5>General Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 The pathogen attacks the plant stems near
the ground, causing the plant to wilt.
•	 Within a few days, the stem turns brown and
decays both above and below the soil.
•	 The fungus is often evident as a white
mycelial mat that grows on the stem and
surrounding soil.•	 Embedded in the mycelia are sclerotia, which
initially appear white and fuzzy but gradually
turn into smooth, hard, round, light tan to
dark brown in color resembling Mustard
seeds.</p>
<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 Sclerotium rolfsii is a non-spore forming
major soil-borne pathogen belonging to
Basidiomycetes.
•	 It is an omnivorous, soil-borne fungal
pathogen which causes diseases in a wide
range of agricultural and horticultural crops.
•	 White mycelium and sclerotia are usually
seen on the surface of infected plant tissue
and surrounding soil.
•	 The mycelium is silky white during the early
growth stages and later becomes dull.</p>
<p>•	 The mycelium forms clamp-connections,
which is a characteristic feature of the fungi.
•	 Sclerotia, the diagnostic sign of this fungus,
are small (1.1 to 2 mm in diameter), reddish
brown spheres that are typically present in
large numbers.
•	 Sclerotia are the primary means of longdistance dissemination and survival
structures of S. rolfsii, since the fungus does
not produce spores.</p>

<h5>RHIZOCTONIA WILT / ROOT ROT</h5>
<p>Hosts: Almost all Vegetable and Horticulture crops.
Causal organism: Rhizoctonia solani.
Distribution: Worldwide but most important in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate areas.</p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Rhizoctonia root rot is becoming a common
and major soil-borne disease that typically
causes severe damage to almost all vegetable
and horticultural crops.
•	 Rusty-brown, dry sunken lesions on stems
and roots near the soil line are characteristic
features of Rhizoctonia infection.</p>
<p>A reddish brown dry cortical root rot and
sloughing off of the cortex layer is another
characteristic symptom of this disease.
•	 Infected seedlings and older plants become
stunted, yellow and may wilt.
•	 The infections can be superficial and cause
no clear damage to plants, or they can girdle
the stem and kill or stunt plants.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 R. solani is commonly present in most soils,
surviving as actively growing mycelium, as
resting mycelium or sometimes as sclerotia.
•	 The species is classified into four genetically
different anastomosis (AG) groups.
•	 Isolates vary greatly in appearance in culture,
some are almost white, but most are in
various shades of brown.
•	 The mycelium appears hyaline or light tan
and has characteristic right angle branching,
often with a slight constriction and a septum
near each branch.
•	 Loosely formed brown to black sclerotia may
appear in culture. </p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>•	 Disease incidence is more common in warm,
moist sandy soils.
•	 High soil temperature and moisture favor
spreading of the disease.
•	 This disease is favored by well drained soils
and stresses including herbicide injury, soil
insect damage and nematode feeding.</p>

<h5>Management of Southern blight and Rhizoctonia wilt</h5>
<p>•	 Practice crop rotation using less susceptible
plants such as Corn, Sorghum, small grains,
and grasses.
•	 Remove and destroy affected plants, along
with roots and a small amount of soil
surrounding the plant.
•	 Drench the root zone of affected and
surrounding plants with
o Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP (Roko/
Spring) @ 2 to 3 gm/ltr + Phyton-T @ 5
ml/ltr at @ 200 to 300 ml/plant.
o Chlorpyriphos 20% EC @ 2 ml/ltr. can
also be mixed if there is any damage due
to insects and nematodes.
•	 Earthing up of drenched plants helps in early
recovery.
•	 If disease spreading persists, repeat drenching
after 15 - 20 days.</p>

<h5>BIO-CONTROL OF SOIL-BORNE DISEASES</h5>
<p>•	 Biological agents, such as Trichoderma
harzianum, T. viride, Gliocladium virens,
Pseudomonas species and Bacillus species
are found to be effective in antagonizing
soil-borne pathogens and suppressing the
disease.
•	 However, bio-control agents can be used
only as a preventive measure.
•	 They can also be used few weeks after
chemical treatment, for maintenance.
•	 Powder and liquid formulations of bio-control
agents are available.
•	 Bio-control agents should be applied to soil
along with farm yard manure before planting.
•	 Mix 1 kg or 1 litre bio-control agents
formulation with 100 kg of properly
composted powdered Farm Yard Manure
(FYM) and moisten (dosage as recommended
by the manufacturer)</p>
<p>•	 Spread the mixture into a bed of about one
foot height and convenient width & length.
•	 Cover with wet gunny cloth to maintain
moisture for the multiplication of bio-control
agents.
•	 Prepare these beds under shade and maintain
for about 15 to 20 days with frequent
watering and mixing.</p>

<h5>POWDERY MILDEWS</h5>
<p>Hosts: Cucurbits, Chilli, Capsicum, Tomato, Okra, Beans, Potato, Grapes, Onion, Garlic,
Groundnut, Papaya, Mango, Rose, Carrot, Beetroot, Mulberry and many other crops.
Causal Organisms: Erysiphe necator, Sphaerotheca fuliginea, Sphaerotheca pannosa, Leveillula
taurica, Oidium arachidis, Oidium mangiferae, Erysiphe polygoni, Erysiphe
cichoracearum, Erysiphe heraclei, and many other species.
Distribution: Temperate and tropical regions of the world.</p>

<h5>General Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Whitish, talc like, powdery growth develops
on both surfaces of leaves, on petioles and
stems of infected plants.
•	 The powdery spots enlarge and coalesce
rapidly and a whitish mass becomes evident
on the upper surface of leaves.
•	 A large part of the talc-like powder on the
leaf surface is composed of spores.</p>
<p>•	 The fungus develops on weeds and its spores
are easily dispersed by winds to nearby
plants.
•	 Heavily infected leaves die but seldom drop
from the plant unlike in case of Chillies and
Capsicum.
•	 In severe cases, the whole plant looks
powdery and weak.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 Powdery mildew causing pathogens are
obligate parasites belonging to Ascomycetes.
•	 The pathogens typically do not grow inside
the plant but send haustoria into the plant
while mycelia grow on the surface.
•	 Eventually, the fungus will produce conidia,
borne singly, or on branched conidiophores.
•	 Conidia are single celled, hyaline and barrelshaped.
•	 The asexual conidia serve as secondary
inoculum to spread the disease following
initial infection.
•	 Some of the pathogens produce
cleistothecia, bearing number of asci with 8
ascospores per ascus.</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>•	 The primary inoculum is believed to be airborne conidia (asexual spores) or cleistothecia
(sexual fruiting body), which survive on crop
debris or alternate hosts.
•	 Conidia are believed to be blown during the
spring and early summer.
•	 Powdery mildew fungi are obligate
ectoparasites and therefore cannot survive in
the absence of living host plants, except as
cleistothecia.
•	 Powdery mildew develops quickly under
favourable conditions like dense plant
growth, low-intensity light, high temperature
and high relative humidity.
•	 The time between infection and symptom
appearance of symptoms is usually 3 to 7
days, and infection can occur at 23 to 370
C. </p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Grow resistant varieties,when available.
•	 Maintain adequate space among plants and
control weeds.
•	 Remove and destroy infected plant parts.
•	 Rotate crops with non-host varieties.
•	 Spray any of the following fungicides
 o Azoxystrobin 23% SC (Amistar/
Mirador) @ 1 ml/ltr. or
 o Kresoxim-Methyl 44.3% SC (Ergon/
Mirador) @ 1 ml/ltr. or
 o Myclobutanil 10% WP (Systhane/
Boon) @ 1 gm/ltr. or
 o Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin
25% WG (Nativo) @ 0.5 gm/ltr. or
 o Tebuconazole 25.9% EC (Folicur) @ 1
ml/ltr. or
 o Hexaconazole 5% SC (Contaf Plus) @
2 ml/ltr. or
 o Sulphur 80% WG (Sultaf) @ 2 gm/ltr.
or
 o Carbendazim 50% WP (Bavistin) @ 1
gm/ltr.
•	 Repeat spray 2 to 3 times at intervals of 7
to 10 days.
•	 Change the fungicides, if the problem
persists.
•	 Sulphur should not be used in Sulphurshy crops like Cucurbits</p>

<h5>RUSTS</h5>
<p>Hosts: Coffee, Beans, Soybean, Grapes, Maize, Wheat, Chrysanthemum, Rose, Onion, Groundnut
and many more crops.
Causal Organisms: Uromyces appendiculatus, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, Physopella ampelopsidis,
Puccinia sorghi, P. triticina, P. allii, P. arachidis, Phragmidium spp.
Distribution: Tropical and sub-tropical areas across the world.</p>

<h5>General Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Rusts exhibit typical reddish brown and
circular uredinial pustules on leaves, stems
and pods.
•	 The uredinium may vary in size from the
size of a pinpoint to several millimetres in
diameter.
•	 Initial symptoms appear 5 to 6 days after
infection as minute, whitish, slightly raised
spots that develop into pustules several days
Leaf (left) and stem rust (right) in Wheat
later.
•	 In summer and mild climates, the uredial stage
persists. In cooler conditions, black, telial stage
pustules are formed towards autumn.
•	 Severe infection causes premature defoliation
and reduced growth in some hosts.
•	 Yield losses can be up to 60 to 80% and are
directly related to early infection and severity.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 Rust pathogens are obligate parasites belong
to Basidiomycetes.
•	 Spores from rust pustules are wind
transmitted and infect through stomatal
openings.
•	 The urediniospores are of various sizes and
they are broadly ellipsoid and red to golden
brown in color•	 Teliospores have a stalked pedicel with a
swelling in the lower portion and vary in
color from golden yellow to black.
•	 Rust fungi with a complete life cycle have
five different spore forms - spermatia,
aeciospores, urediospores, teliospores, and
basidiospores. </p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>•	 The rust fungi are obligate ecto-parasites that
require the living host for completion of their
life cycle.
•	 The inoculum survives in the form of
uredospores / teliospores during off seasons
on alternate/ volunteer hosts, which serve as
excellent sources of inoculum.
•	 Uredospores are extremely efficient in
spreading disease because they are produced
in large quantities and are easily spread by •	 The complete cycle from infection to
production of new spores can take as little
as 7 days during ideal conditions.
•	 Low temperatures (16-250
C), high humidity
and long day length is favourable for disease
outbreaks.
•	 Rust fungi have complex life cycles with five
different spore stages, which may require
two specifically different host plants.</p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Grow resistant varieties, if available.
•	 Rotate crops with non-host plants.
•	 Remove and destroy infected plant parts.
•	 Maintain proper spacing and control weeds.
•	 Spray any of the following fungicides
o Triadimefon 50% WP (Bayleton) @
0.3 gm/ltr. or
o Tebuconazole & Trifloxystrobin
50% + 25 % WG (Nativo) @ 0.5 gm/
ltr. or
o Hexaconazole 5% SC (Contaf Plus) @ 2 ml/ltr. or
o Propiconazole 25% EC (Tilt) @ 1
ml/ltr. or
o Tebuconazole 25.9% EC (Folicur) @
1 ml/ltr. or
o Zineb 75% WP (Indofil Z-78) at 2
gm/ltr. or
o Chlorothalonil 75% WP (Splash/
Jatayu) @2 gm/ltr.
•	 Repeat spray 2-3 times at intervals of 7 to
10 days.
•	 Change the fungicides, if the problem
persists</p>

<h5>Smuts</h5>
<p>•	 Smuts are important diseases of cereals
and grasses caused by fungal species like
Ustilago.
•	 The disease is stage specific i.e. it affects the
crops at the reproductive stage and is organ
specific affecting the ovary of the flower.
•	 Cereals like Wheat, Sorghum, Maize, Barley,
Rice are affected by smuts.
•	 Smuts caused by Basidiomycetes of the order
Ustilaginales, occur throughout the world.
•	 Many smuts attack the grain kernels and
replace kernel contents with the black, dusty
spore masses that resemble soot.
•	 Reduction in the yield is conspicuous and
quality of the produce is reduced drastically</p>
<p>•	 Most smut fungi attack ovaries of grains
and develop in them and in the fruit, i.e.,
the kernel of grain crops, which they destroy
completely.
•	 Smut fungi produce only two kinds of spores;
teliospores and basidiospores.</p>

<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Smut pathogen causes various symptoms
affecting the inflorescence and occasionally
the foliage.
•	 The individual grains are replaced by smut
sori.
•	 The sori are oval or cylindrical and are
covered with a tough creamy skin (peridium)
composed of brown to black spores.
•	 The infected plants exhibit sterility and
various forms of panicle phyllody.
•	 Some cultivars are dwarfed because of lack
of elongation of penduncle.
•	 Affected plants tiller excessively, have weak
root system and exhibit severe root rot and
stalk rots than do plants without smut.
•	 Ratoon crops exhibit higher incidence of the
disease.
•	 There are various types of smuts like grain
smut, kernel smut, loose smut, head smut,
long smut and covered smut.</p>
<h5>Pathogens</h5>
<p>•	 Corn smut - Ustilago maydis
•	 Sugarcane smut - Ustilago scitaminae
•	 Grain smut/Kernel smut / Covered smut of
Sorghum - Sphacelotheca sorghi
•	 Loose smut/ Kernel smut of Sorghum -
Sphacelotheca cruenta
•	 Long smut of Sorghum - Tolyposporium
ehrenbergii
•	 Head smut of Sorghum - Sphacelotheca
reiliana
•	 False smut of Rice - Ustilaginoidea virens
•	 Loose smut of Wheat - Ustilago tritici
•	 Loose smut of Oats - Ustilago avenae
•	 Covered smut of Oats - Ustilago kolleri
•	 Covered smut of Barley - Ustilago hordei</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>•	 Smuts generally overwinter as teliospores on
contaminated seeds, in plant debris or in the
soil.
•	 The pathogen resumes activity along with
seed germination, grows upward systemically
in the plant within the apical meristem,
as hyaline mycelium and enters the seed
primordial, when the plants form the head.
•	 Typically, young spikelets are colonized by
intracellular mycelium, which destroys most
of the ear tissue, except the rachis, and
converts the spikelets into sori.
•	 The mycelium in sori differentiates into
brown, spherical teliospores forming a loose
mass of spores in place of the kernels.
•	 Formation of spores coincides with the
flowering of healthy neighboring plants;
the teliospores are dispersed onto the open
flowers of these plants, where they invade
the ovaries to repeat the cycle.
•	 Within a day, teliospores germinate and form
4-celled monocaryotic promycelia (basidia).
•	 After fusion of sexually compatible (+ and -)
haploid hyphae produced by the promycelium,
the resulting dikaryotic infective hyphae
penetrate the flower through the stigma or
the ovary wall.
•	 The mycelium becomes established in the
pericarp, scutellum and embryonic tissue
before the kernels are mature.
•	 During maturation of the caryopsis, the
mycelium becomes dormant swollen and
thick-walled.
•	 Rainy, humid weather is critical for infections,
but there are observations of smut prevalence
during dry weather also.
•	 Excessive doses of Nitrogenous fertilizers
increases smut incidence, while phosphate
fertilization tends to decrease incidence. </p>

<h5>Management</h5>
<p>•	 Use resistant cultivars, if available.
•	 Use disease free seeds.
•	 Rotate crops with non-hosts.
•	 Collect the infected ear heads in cloth bags
and destroy by burying in soil or burning.
•	 In organic farming systems, hot-water
treatments (49-520
C for 12 minutes) are
used to control loose smut of cereals.
•	 Seed treatment with a systemic fungicide,
which is able to penetrate into the seed, also
is effective.
•	 Carboxin (Vitavax) and Triazoles have been
reported to be highly effective.
•	 Accordingly, products containing azoles such
as Triadimenol, Bitertanol, Tebuconazole,
Prothioconazole, Triticonazole and
Fluquinconazole effectively control the
disease.</p>

<h5>Ergots</h5>
<p>•	 Ergots are important diseases of cereals
and grasses caused by fungal species like
Claviceps, Sphacelotheca (Sporiosorium),
etc.
•	 This disease is generally stage specific i.e.
they affect the crops at the reproductive stage
and is organ specific affecting the ovary of
the flower.
•	 Cereals like Sorghum, Rye, Pearl millet,
Wheat, Barley are affected by Ergots.
•	 Ergot, also known as honeydew or sugary
disease, occurs throughout the world.
•	 The disease affects individual florets in
a panicle causing poor development or
preventing development of grain.
•	 The disease caused by species of the fungi
Claviceps like C. purpurea, C. sorghi, C.
africana, etc., which destroy the grains in
infected heads.
•	 The disease in important due to the fact that
it replaces the grains with fungal sclerotia,
which are poisonous to humans and animals.
•	 Ergot occurs most commonly on Sorghum,
Rye and Pearl millet, less often on Wheat
and certain wild and cultivated grasses and
rarely on Barley and Oats.</p>

<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 The first symptoms appear as creamy droplets
of a sticky liquid exuding from young florets
of infected heads.
•	 The droplets containing masses of conidia
of the fungus are sweet (honeydew stage)
and attract numerous insects, which feed on
them and spread the disease to other heads.
•	 A saprophytic fungus, Cerebella volkensii
may overgrow the honeydew and convert
it into a hard, horn-shaped, sticky, matted,
black mass (ergot stage).
•	 After approximately two weeks, infected
grains are replaced by dark, compact fungal
structures.
•	 These are sclerotia or
ergots of the fungus
that grow in place of
the kernel and consist
of a hard compact mass
of fungal tissue.
•	 Sclerotia range in size
from 16 – 20 mm
in length, and often
look like seeds, rodent
droppings or insect
parts.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>•	 Claviceps is the perfect state and Sphacelia is
the imperfect state of the causal fungus.
•	 Mycelium in an infected ovary produces
conidia that are hyaline, elliptic or oblong
and slightly constricted in the middle.
•	 The honey dew is a concentrated suspension
of conidia in a sugary fluid.
•	 Sclerotia, which develop in infected ovaries
are cylindric and slightly curved.
•	 On germination, each sclerotium produces
two to three stromata, which contain flask
shaped perithecia, each containing many
asci.
•	 Asci are cylindric and each ascus produces
eight filiform, hyaline ascospores.</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>•	 Sclerotia survive in soil and harvested grain
as concomitant contamination.
•	 Sclerotia require a one to two month period
of cold temperatures (0-100
C) after which
they germinate to form small, mushroom-like
structures that produce sexual spores.
•	 Germination is most common in cool (14-
290
C), damp weather and is inhibited at
higher temperatures.
•	 Sexual spores are blown to developing grain
heads where infection occurs.
•	 Humid weather (> 90% relative humidity)
contributes to honeydew production.
•	 Ergot is also often severe if frosts occur at the
time of spore production.
•	 Primary inoculum is provided either by
ascospores from germinated sclerotia or by
conidia from soil surface, plant debris or
alternate hosts.
•	 Sclerotia mixed with seed are also responsible
