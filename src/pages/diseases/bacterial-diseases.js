<h2>Diseases</h2>
<h3>Bacterial Diseases</h3>
<p>Bacteria are prokaryotic microorganisms that
are typically a few micrometres in length.
•	 These single celled microorganisms are
usually found in masses or chains of several
individuals.
•	 Bacteria are found in most habitats be it soil,
water, acidic hot springs, deep down the
earth’s crust and even on radioactive waste.
•	 While a great majority of bacteria are obligate
saprophytes, many become parasitic and
cause diseases of humans, animals and
plants.
•	 More than 80 species of bacteria and their
numerous subspecies, also called pathovars
(pv), are known to cause diseases in plants.
•	 However, about half of all known plant
pathogenic bacteria belong to the genus
Pseudomonas, about one third to the genus
Xanthomonas and about an eighth to the
genus Erwinia.
•	 While Bacteria appear in several shapes
such as spherical, ellipsoidal, rod-shaped,
spiral, comma-shaped or filamentous,
interestingly, almost all the plant pathogenic
bacteria are rod-shaped, only exception
being Streptomyces, which is filamentous.</p>

<p>Most plant pathogenic bacteria are flagellate.
•	 The rod-shaped bacterial cells may be
monotrichous (single flagellum at one end),
lophotrichous (a tuft of flagella at one end), amphitrichous (a single or tuft of flagella
at both ends), or peritrichous (flagella
distributed all over the surface).</p>

<p>Almost all plant pathogenic bacteria grow
parasitically in the host plant and partly in
debris or in the soil as saprophytes.
•	 Agrobacterium tumefaciens (crown gall),
Pseudomonas solanacearum (bacterial wilt)
and Streptomyces scabies (common scab of
Potato) have the ability to survive indefinitely
in soil as saprophytes in the absence of their
hosts (soil inhabitants).
•	 But, most plant pathogenic bacteria have
poor ability to survive in soil for long in
the absence of their respective hosts (soil
invaders).
•	 They reproduce asexually mainly by binary
fission once in 20 - 30 minutes producing
one million cells in ten hours provided the
conditions are favourable.
•	 Bacterial diseases in crop plants affect stems,
leaves, fruits, roots, or are carried internally
without external symptoms.
•	 They can cause a variety of symptoms
including spots, blights, wilts, cankers, galls,
scabs, etc.
•	 These symptoms can be extremely noticeable
and characteristic, but can also be difficult to
spot and diagnose.
•	 Most of the bacterial diseases are caused
by different species of two major genera
Pseudomonas (Ralstonia) and Xanthomonas.
•	 However, some others like cankers, rots,
galls, and scabs are caused by species of
Clavibacter, Erwinia, Clostridium, Bacillus,
Agrobacterium, Streptomyces, etc.</p>

<h5>Bacterial Spots</h5>
<p>Leaf spots are the most common of bacterial
diseases.
•	 Spots appear on leaves, blossoms, stems
and fruits.
•	 Spots on leaves of dicot plants are initially
confined between the leaf veins and will
appear angular and water-soaked.
•	 In monocots, symptoms appear as streaks or
stripes. </p>
<p>Spots may coalesce resulting in large areas
of necrotic tissue often surrounded by a
chlorotic halo.
•	 In some cases bacterial ooze, which is a
characteristic feature for diagnosis of bacterial
infections is also seen.
•	 Almost all bacterial leaf spots and blights
are caused by the members of genera
Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas</p>

<h5>BACTERIAL BLIGHTS
</h5>
<p>Symptoms vary depending on the crop and
the plant part affected.
•	 Bacterial blight of Rice and Pomegranate are
among the more serious bacterial blights.
•	 In Rice, symptoms appear on the leaves
as pale-green to grey-green, water-soaked
streaks near the tip and margins.
•	 These lesions coalesce and become yellowishwhite with wavy edges. </p>
<p>The whole leaf may eventually be affected,
which become whitish or greyish and die.
•	 In Pomegranate, one to many small watersoaked, dark colored, irregular spots appear
on leaves.
•	 Premature defoliation occurs under severe
conditions.
•	 The pathogen also infects stem, fruits and
branches causing girdling and cracking
symptoms.</p>

<h5>BACTERIAL VASCULAR WILTS</h5>
<p>Vascular wilts caused by bacteria primarily
affect herbaceous vegetable crops, field
crops, ornamentals and some tropical plants.
•	 The pathogen enters, multiplies and moves
through the xylem vessels of the host plant
and interferes with the translocation of
nutrients and water by producing gum.
•	 Wilting starts with the lower leaves, and within 2-3 days, the whole plant wilts and
collapses.
•	 The wilt is almost sudden and the leaves do
not exhibit any yellowing as seen in wilts
caused by fungi like Fusarium or Verticillium.
•	 When the crown region is cut open, vascular
browning is seen and it yields bacterial ooze
when kept in a test tube containing clear
water.</p>
<p>Ralstonia solanacearum causes the wilt in
Solanaceous crops like Tomato, Tobacco,
Eggplant, Hot & Sweet Peppers, Potato and
Ginger, Banana, etc.
•	 Erwinia tracheiphila causes wilt in cucurbits
like Zuchini, Cucumber, Melons, etc.
•	 Cucurbit wilts are transmitted by striped and
spotted cucumber beetles.
•	 Stewart’s wilt of Maize caused by Erwinia
stewartii is transmitted by flea beetles.
•	 It is a seed-borne disease as well.</p>

<h5>BACTERIAL SOFT ROTS</h5>
<p>The soft rots causing bacteria include Erwinia
spp., Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp. and
Clostridium spp.
•	 Many soft rots are caused by nonphytopathogenic saprophytic bacteria.
•	 Soft rots affect a large number of hosts
causing damage to fleshy parts of the plants
both in the standing crop and during storage. </p>
<p>The bacteria enter through wounds and
produce enzymes that break down the middle
lamella causing separation of the cells, death
and degeneration at the site of the infection.
•	 The infected tissues become watery, soft and
slimy and foul smelling.</p>

<h5>LITTLE LEAF DISEASE</h5>
<p>This is a serious disease of Brinjal caused by
Phytoplasma.
•	 Recently it is found to infect Beans also. </p>
<p>The disease is transmitted by leaf hoppers
(Cestius (Hishimonus) phycitis and Amrasca
biguttula).
</p>

<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Disease affected plants are generally shorter
in stature and bear more number of branches
and leaves smaller than healthy plants.
•	 The leaves turn light yellow and are smaller
in size and malformed.
•	 The petioles get shorter considerably,
many buds appear in the axil of leaves andinternodes get shortened thus giving the
plants a bushy rosetted appearance.
•	 Flower parts are deformed leading to sterility.
•	 Infected plants seldom produce fruits and if
any fruit is formed, it becomes hard and fails
to mature.</p>
<h5>Management</h5>
<p>Uproot and burn infected plants immediately
on noticing the symptoms.
•	 Use barrier crops or trap crops.
•	 Adopt sanitary measures including
eradication of susceptible volunteer crop
plants. Schedule sowing time to avoid the main
flights of the beet leaf hopper.
•	 Spray systemic insecticides starting with the
appearance of the leaf hoppers to control
their population.
•	 Power Plus has proved to control this
disease also.</p>
