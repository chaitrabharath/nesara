<h2>Diseases</h2>
<h3>Bacterial Diseases</h3>
<p>Bacteria are prokaryotic microorganisms that
are typically a few micrometres in length.
•	 These single celled microorganisms are
usually found in masses or chains of several
individuals.
•	 Bacteria are found in most habitats be it soil,
water, acidic hot springs, deep down the
earth’s crust and even on radioactive waste.
•	 While a great majority of bacteria are obligate
saprophytes, many become parasitic and
cause diseases of humans, animals and
plants.
•	 More than 80 species of bacteria and their
numerous subspecies, also called pathovars
(pv), are known to cause diseases in plants.
•	 However, about half of all known plant
pathogenic bacteria belong to the genus
Pseudomonas, about one third to the genus
Xanthomonas and about an eighth to the
genus Erwinia.
•	 While Bacteria appear in several shapes
such as spherical, ellipsoidal, rod-shaped,
spiral, comma-shaped or filamentous,
interestingly, almost all the plant pathogenic
bacteria are rod-shaped, only exception
being Streptomyces, which is filamentous.</p>

<p>Most plant pathogenic bacteria are flagellate.
•	 The rod-shaped bacterial cells may be
monotrichous (single flagellum at one end),
lophotrichous (a tuft of flagella at one end), amphitrichous (a single or tuft of flagella
at both ends), or peritrichous (flagella
distributed all over the surface).</p>

<p>Almost all plant pathogenic bacteria grow
parasitically in the host plant and partly in
debris or in the soil as saprophytes.
•	 Agrobacterium tumefaciens (crown gall),
Pseudomonas solanacearum (bacterial wilt)
and Streptomyces scabies (common scab of
Potato) have the ability to survive indefinitely
in soil as saprophytes in the absence of their
hosts (soil inhabitants).
•	 But, most plant pathogenic bacteria have
poor ability to survive in soil for long in
the absence of their respective hosts (soil
invaders).
•	 They reproduce asexually mainly by binary
fission once in 20 - 30 minutes producing
one million cells in ten hours provided the
conditions are favourable.
•	 Bacterial diseases in crop plants affect stems,
leaves, fruits, roots, or are carried internally
without external symptoms.
•	 They can cause a variety of symptoms
including spots, blights, wilts, cankers, galls,
scabs, etc.
•	 These symptoms can be extremely noticeable
and characteristic, but can also be difficult to
spot and diagnose.
•	 Most of the bacterial diseases are caused
by different species of two major genera
Pseudomonas (Ralstonia) and Xanthomonas.
•	 However, some others like cankers, rots,
galls, and scabs are caused by species of
Clavibacter, Erwinia, Clostridium, Bacillus,
Agrobacterium, Streptomyces, etc.</p>

<h5>Bacterial Spots</h5>
<p>Leaf spots are the most common of bacterial
diseases.
•	 Spots appear on leaves, blossoms, stems
and fruits.
•	 Spots on leaves of dicot plants are initially
confined between the leaf veins and will
appear angular and water-soaked.
•	 In monocots, symptoms appear as streaks or
stripes. </p>
<p>Spots may coalesce resulting in large areas
of necrotic tissue often surrounded by a
chlorotic halo.
•	 In some cases bacterial ooze, which is a
characteristic feature for diagnosis of bacterial
infections is also seen.
•	 Almost all bacterial leaf spots and blights
are caused by the members of genera
Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas</p>

<h5>BACTERIAL BLIGHTS
</h5>
<p>Symptoms vary depending on the crop and
the plant part affected.
•	 Bacterial blight of Rice and Pomegranate are
among the more serious bacterial blights.
•	 In Rice, symptoms appear on the leaves
as pale-green to grey-green, water-soaked
streaks near the tip and margins.
•	 These lesions coalesce and become yellowishwhite with wavy edges. </p>
<p>The whole leaf may eventually be affected,
which become whitish or greyish and die.
•	 In Pomegranate, one to many small watersoaked, dark colored, irregular spots appear
on leaves.
•	 Premature defoliation occurs under severe
conditions.
•	 The pathogen also infects stem, fruits and
branches causing girdling and cracking
symptoms.</p>

<h5>BACTERIAL VASCULAR WILTS</h5>
<p>Vascular wilts caused by bacteria primarily
affect herbaceous vegetable crops, field
crops, ornamentals and some tropical plants.
•	 The pathogen enters, multiplies and moves
through the xylem vessels of the host plant
and interferes with the translocation of
nutrients and water by producing gum.
•	 Wilting starts with the lower leaves, and within 2-3 days, the whole plant wilts and
collapses.
•	 The wilt is almost sudden and the leaves do
not exhibit any yellowing as seen in wilts
caused by fungi like Fusarium or Verticillium.
•	 When the crown region is cut open, vascular
browning is seen and it yields bacterial ooze
when kept in a test tube containing clear
water.</p>
<p>Ralstonia solanacearum causes the wilt in
Solanaceous crops like Tomato, Tobacco,
Eggplant, Hot & Sweet Peppers, Potato and
Ginger, Banana, etc.
•	 Erwinia tracheiphila causes wilt in cucurbits
like Zuchini, Cucumber, Melons, etc.
•	 Cucurbit wilts are transmitted by striped and
spotted cucumber beetles.
•	 Stewart’s wilt of Maize caused by Erwinia
stewartii is transmitted by flea beetles.
•	 It is a seed-borne disease as well.</p>

<h5>BACTERIAL SOFT ROTS</h5>
<p>The soft rots causing bacteria include Erwinia
spp., Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp. and
Clostridium spp.
•	 Many soft rots are caused by nonphytopathogenic saprophytic bacteria.
•	 Soft rots affect a large number of hosts
causing damage to fleshy parts of the plants
both in the standing crop and during storage. </p>
<p>The bacteria enter through wounds and
produce enzymes that break down the middle
lamella causing separation of the cells, death
and degeneration at the site of the infection.
•	 The infected tissues become watery, soft and
slimy and foul smelling.</p>

<h5>LITTLE LEAF DISEASE</h5>
<p>This is a serious disease of Brinjal caused by
Phytoplasma.
•	 Recently it is found to infect Beans also. </p>
<p>The disease is transmitted by leaf hoppers
(Cestius (Hishimonus) phycitis and Amrasca
biguttula).
</p>

<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Disease affected plants are generally shorter
in stature and bear more number of branches
and leaves smaller than healthy plants.
•	 The leaves turn light yellow and are smaller
in size and malformed.
•	 The petioles get shorter considerably,
many buds appear in the axil of leaves andinternodes get shortened thus giving the
plants a bushy rosetted appearance.
•	 Flower parts are deformed leading to sterility.
•	 Infected plants seldom produce fruits and if
any fruit is formed, it becomes hard and fails
to mature.</p>
<h5>Management</h5>
<p>Uproot and burn infected plants immediately
on noticing the symptoms.
•	 Use barrier crops or trap crops.
•	 Adopt sanitary measures including
eradication of susceptible volunteer crop
plants. Schedule sowing time to avoid the main
flights of the beet leaf hopper.
•	 Spray systemic insecticides starting with the
appearance of the leaf hoppers to control
their population.
•	 Power Plus has proved to control this
disease also.</p>

<h4> BLACK ROT OF CRUCIFERS</h4>
<p>It is caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv.
campestris.
•	 Characteristic black rot symptoms appear
along the margins of leaves as yellow,
V-shaped lesions pointed towards a vein.
•	 The lesions enlarge and tissue wilting
progresses towards the base of leaves.
•	 Eventually, affected areas become necrotic
and the veins turn black or brown. </p>
<p>The infection moves down the vascular
tissue of petioles, spreads through stems and
finally into the roots.
•	 The vascular bundles in the infected plant
parts become black followed by black rotting
of the internal tissues in the lower part of the
stem.
•	 Cabbage heads and Cauliflower curds are
also invaded and discolored.</p>

<h4>BACTERIAL CANKERS </h4>
<p>Canker symptoms can appear on barks,
stems, small twigs and fruits.
•	 The lesions first appear as small watery
translucent spots, which enlarge, turn darkgreen or orange brown with age.
•	 The host tissues around the affected area rise
to form convex spots.
•	 The central regions of the spots gradually
turn light-brown, spongy and breakdown giving crater-like appearance.
•	 With age, the spots become corky and brown,
sometimes pinkish, and appear cankerous.
•	 Xanthomonas axonopodis subspecies citri
causes Citrus canker.
•	 Clavibacter michiganensis subspecies
michiganensis causes bacterial canker in
Tomato.</p>

<h4>BACTERIAL GALLS</h4>
<p>Bacterial galls, also known as Crown galls
are produced mostly by Agrobacterium
spp. and also by certain species of
Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, Rhizobacter
and Rhodococcus.
•	 Agrobacterium tumefaciens (new name -
Rhizobium radiobacter), A. rubi and A. vitis
are responsible for galls in majority of the
plants.
•	 These are soil bacteria, which enter the host
through wounds and cause hyperplasia and hypertrophy in plant tissue by rapid and
continuous cell division.
•	 Crown gall first appears as small, whitish,
soft round overgrowth typically on the plants
crown or the main root.
•	 The color of galls (tumors) caused by A.
tumefaciens can be orange-brown and as
it enlarges the surface becomes convoluted
and dark brown.
•	 Gall damage can be benign to fatal.</p>

<h4>BLACK ARM OF COTTON</h4>
<p>Black arm disease is caused by Xanthomonas
campestris pv. malvacearum.
•	 This is a seed-borne and highly seed
transmitted disease.
•	 In seedlings, the common symptoms are
water-soaked, circular or irregular lesions
on cotyledons, which spread to petiole and
stem.
•	 Finally withering and death of seedling
results known as seedling blight.
•	 Small, dark green, water-soaked areas develop on lower surface of leaves, enlarge gradually
and become angular when restricted by veins
and veinlets and spots become visible on
both the surfaces of leaves.
•	 The infected veins and veinlets show
blackening, leaves become crinkled and
twisted and bacterial oozing is also seen
(vein necrosis or vein blighting).
•	 Black lesions on stem and branches,
premature dropping off of the leaves result in
die back known as Black arm.
•	 It also affects the bolls causing boll rot.</p>

<h4>BACTERIAL SCABS </h4>
<p>Bacterial scabs primarily infect below ground
parts of plants as in Potatoes.
•	 Common scab of Potato is caused by
Streptomyces scabies, which cause localized
scabby lesions on the outer surface of the
tuber.
•	 Typically corky tissue will form below and
around the lesion.
•	 Rot pathogens can gain entrance into the
host tissue through these lesions and cause
further damage.</p>

<h4>Epidemiology of Bacterial Diseases</h4>
<p>Bacterial diseases are favored by warm
temperatures (25 - 300
C), high humidity and
rain.
•	 The bacteria spread by splashing or
windblown rain, severe winds, plant to plant
contact, farming tools and due to handling
during transplanting.
•	 Bacterial wilts are favored by neutral pH,
moderate to high soil temperature and soil
type, which influence soil moisture and
microbial populations.
•	 High temperatures (30 - 350
C) and high soil
moisture are the main factors associated
with incidence and severity of wilts.
•	 Irrigation water and contaminated farming
equipment favor the spread of the disease
from infected field to healthy field.
•	 The bacteria enter the plants through
wounds caused during emergence of lateral
roots and transplanting or through wounds
caused by nematodes, insects and farm
equipment.</p>

<h4>Management of Bacterial Diseases</h4>
<p>Relatively less work has been done on
the management of bacterial diseases as
compared to fungal diseases.
•	 Very few chemical formulations are available
for their management.</p>
<h5>Cultural Practices </h5>
<p>Grow resistant varieties/hybrids, if available.
•	 Use disease free seedlings.
•	 Rotate crop with non-hosts to reduce
inoculum.
•	 Disinfect farm equipment/tools by washing
with formaldehyde to avoid spread of
inoculum from one field to another.
•	 Adopt furrow or drip irrigation and never use
overhead irrigation like sprinklers.</p>
<p>Never allow water to flow from infected area
to non-infected area.
•	 In case of black arm disease of Cotton:
o	 Remove and destroy the infected plant
debris.
o	 Rogue out the volunteer Cotton plants
and weed hosts.
•	 In case of black rot of Cole crops, remove the
crop residues from the field after harvesting
the heads.
•	 Never plough back the residues into the field
to avoid the build up of inoculum.
•	 Crop residues may be composted and then
applied to the field.</p>

<h4>Seed treatment </h4>
<p>Wherever the bacterium is seed-borne, e.g.,
Bacterial Spot of Tomato, seed treatment is
recommended.
•	 Treat the seeds with 1% hydrochloric acid for
15 - 20 minutes.
•	 Treatment is to be done immediately after
routine fermentation in Tomato.
•	 Produce seeds only in dry seasons to reduce
spread of bacteria through rain splash.</p>
<p>In case of black arm disease of Cotton,
delint the Cotton seeds with concentrated
Sulphuric acid at 100 ml/kg of seed.
•	 Treat the acid delinted seeds with Carboxin
or Oxycarboxin at 2 gm/kg or soak the
seeds in 1000 ppm Streptomycin Sulphate
overnight.</p>

<h4>Foliar spray</h4>
<p>Copper fungicides are also anti-bacterial in
action.
•	 Spray a combination of a Copper fungicide
like
o Copper Oxychloride 50% WP (Blitox) @
3 gm/ltr. or
o Copper Hydroxide 77% WP (Kocide) @
2 gm/ltr.
•	 Add an antibiotic / bactericide like
Streptocycline or T-Cycline or
Bacterinashak @ 0.25 gm/ltr. to the
fungicide.
•	 Spray at least twice at an interval of 7 to 8
days.
•	 Add Phyton-T @ 5 ml/ltr along with the
above mentioned combination for faster
recovery from the damage.</p>

<h4>Soil drenching (for wilts)</h4>
<p>Dip the roots of seedlings in 100 ppm (100
mg/ltr.) solution of Streptocycline/Tcycline/K-cycline/Bactrinashak for 10-15
minutes before transplanting.
•	 Drench the soil around affected and
surrounding plants with solution containing
o Copper Oxychloride 50% WP (Blitox) @
3 gm/ltr. or
o Copper Hydroxide 77% WP (Kocide) @
3 gm/ltr.
in combination with Streptocycline/
T-cycline/K-cycline/ Bactrinashak @ 0.3
to 0.5 gm/ltr., at the rate of 200 - 300 ml/
plant.
Repeat drenching after 20-25 days.
•	 Add Phyton-T @ 5 ml/ltr. along with the
above mentioned combination for faster
recovery</p>
