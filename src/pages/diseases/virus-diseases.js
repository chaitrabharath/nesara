<h2>Diseases</h2>
<h3>Virus Diseases</h3>
<p>Viruses are small infectious agents that
need the host for their survival, growth and
reproduction.</p>
<p> They can infect all types of life forms, from
animals and plants to microorganisms,
including bacteria and archaea.</p>
<p> As pathogens, viruses are always intracellular,
moving from cell to cell throughout the plant
by way of plasmodesmata and vascular
transport systems, most commonly the
phloem.</p>
<p>While some viruses, such as Cucumber
Mosaic virus, die quickly if outside a cell or if
the cell dies, other viruses such as Tobacco
Mosaic virus retain their ability to infect for
years after the infected plant part dies.</p>
<p> Many different viruses can infect plants and
disease spreads from infected plant to healthy
plants by the following ways.</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
    o	 Mechanically by way of contaminated
workers’ hands, tools and equipment.</li>
<li>o	 Majority of the plant viral diseases are
spread by insect vectors like Aphids,
Thrips, Whitefly, Leafhopper, Mite or
Nematodes.</li>
<li>o	 And also through grafting.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Important Virus diseases and their means of transmission</h4>
<img src={virus_table}/>

<h4>TOBACCO MOSAIC VIRUS (TMV)</h4>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Symptoms include mosaic, mottling,
necrosis, stunting, leaf curling and yellowing
of plant tissues.</p>
<p>The symptoms depend on the host plant,
age of the infected plant, environmental 
conditions, virus strain and the genetic
background of the host plant.</p>
<p>Strains of TMV also infect Tomato, sometime
causing poor yield or distorted fruits, delayed
fruit ripening and non-uniform fruit color.
</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>TMV is a single stranded RNA virus.
•	 It is an important member of the genus
Tobamovirus.
•	 The rod-shaped virus particles (virions) of
TMV measure about 300 nm x 15 nm.
•	 A single TMV particle is composed of
2,130 copies of the coat protein (CP) that
envelope the RNA molecule of about 6,400
nucleotides.</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>TMV enters only through wounds caused by
various means.</p>
<p> The virus is very easily transmitted when an
infected leaf rubs against a leaf of a healthy
plant.</p>
<p>It gets transmitted during various fieldoperations like weeding, staking, pruning,
harvesting through contaminated tools,
workers’ hands and clothes.</p>
<p> Cigarette smoking workers may also transmit
the virus.</p>
<p> The virus is externally seed-borne. </p>

<h4>TOMATO SPOTTED WILT VIRUS (TOSPO/TSWV)</h4>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Numerous small, dark, circular spots appear
first on the younger leaves.
•	 Raised spots that render a rough appearance
are characteristic of the disease.
•	 Growing tips may die-back and terminal
stems appear streaked.</p>
<p>On older plants too, more or less same
damage can be observed on the growing tips
and the foliage becomes yellow.
•	 In severe cases defoliation occurs.
•	 On the fruits, numerous spots with concentric
alternate bands of red and yellow are seen. </p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV) belongs
to the genus Tospovirus of the family
Bunyaviridae.</p>
<p>This is the only genus in the family
Bunyaviridae that comprises of plant
infecting viruses.</p>
<p>The viral genome consists of three single
stranded-RNAs.</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>TSWV is found to infect many plants, including
Solanaceous crops (Tomato, Pepper, Potato
and Tobacco), Pea, Lettuce, numerous
weeds, vegetables and ornamentals.</p>
<p>The virus is generally spread by thrips, which
are tiny and are easily blown into fields.</p>
<p>They multiply quickly and feed on a wide
range of plants.</p>
<p>Thrips feed on the under surface of leaves by puncturing the tissues and sucking the juices
that flow from the injury.</p>
<p>Young (larval stage) thrips acquire TSWV
from infected plants and then spread the
virus as adults when they fly from plant to
plant.</p>
<p> Infected weeds or other plants are generally
the source of the virus.</p>

<h4>BUD NECROSIS VIRUS (BNV)</h4>
<p>Bud necrosis is an unusual viral disease
affecting many crop plants including Peanut,
Watermelon, Soybean, Sunflower, Grapes,
etc. </p>
<p>It is a serious threat particularly in Watermelon
and Peanut growing regions throughout the
world leading to severe crop losses.
</p>

<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Initial symptoms show leaf crinkling, mottling,
yellowing, necrotic streaks on young leaves
and petiole.
•	 As the disease progresses, shortening of
internodes, necrosis and dieback of the buds
are observed.
•	 Necrosis extends from the leaf to the petiole
and terminal bud resulting in necrosis of the
terminal bud.
•	 Secondary symptoms include stunting,
auxiliary shoot proliferation, and malformation of leaflets.
•	 The virus can cause severe crop losses,
especially when the plants are infected before
they are a month old.
•	 Seeds from such plants are small, shrivelled,
mottled and discolored.
•	 Symptoms produced by Peanut Bud Necrosis
Virus (PBNV) in Groundnut are difficult to
distinguish, if at all, from those caused by
Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV).</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>It is a distinct member in the genus Tospovirus
of the family Bunyaviridae.
</p>
<p>Based on the host, the virus is designated
differently as Peanut Bud Necrosis Virus,
Watermelon Bud Necrosis Virus, etc. </p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>BNV is transmitted by both mechanical
means and through insect vector thrips, in a
persistent (propagative) manner.
•	 There are different species of thrips, which
transmit the disease in different host plants
(Thrips palmi, T. flavus, etc.).</p>
<p>Disease occurs throughout the year but its
incidence is generally higher during hot and
dry periods when thrips population increases
rapidly. </p>

<h4>TOMATO LEAF CURL VIRUS (TLCV) and
TOMATO YELLOW LEAF CURL VIRUS (TYLCV)</h4>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>TLCV causes dwarfing, puckering, typical
downward rolling and severe curling of the
leaves with mottling and excessive branching.</p>
<p>Whereas TYLCV causes bright yellow and
green mottle associated with severe leaf
curling.</p>
<p>The newly formed leaves show chlorosis while the older leaves become leathery and
brittle.
•	 The diseased plants look pale and produce
more lateral branches resulting in bushy
growth.
•	 Severe infection leads to partial or complete
sterility of the plant.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>Tomato Leaf Curl Virus belongs to the family
Geminiviridae.
•	 TYLCV has geminate particles, which are
isometric, 18 - 20 nm in diameter.
•	 The genome contains a single-stranded
circular DNA.</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>TYLCV is primarily transmitted by the
Sweet Potato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and
the biotype B or silver leaf whitefly (Bemisia
argentifolii).
•	 These whiteflies can acquire the virus by
feeding on infected plants, and they remain
infective for life.
•	 A period of at least 15 minutes feeding on the
new Tomato host is required for subsequent
transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>TYLCV cannot spread through seed or
mechanical means.
•	 Long-distance spread of TYLCV occurs
primarily by movement of infected plant
material or by wind dispersal of whiteflies
harboring the virus.
•	 Hot and dry conditions that favor the whitefly,
help the spread of TYLCV during summer. </p>

<h4>BEANS GOLDEN YELLOW MOSAIC VIRUS (BGYMV)</h4>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>The diagnostic symptom of Bean Golden
Yellow Mosaic is the bright yellow to green
mosaic or mottled appearance of infected
leaves, which becomes most apparent as the
leaves get older.
•	 Infected leaves show varying degrees of leaf
distortion, down cupping and wrinkling</p>
<p>Plants infected at a young age may show
stunted growth.
•	 The infection rapidly spreads, if the infected
plants are not removed and whiteflies are not
effectively controlled.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>Bean Golden Yellow Mosaic Virus is a species
that belongs to genus Geminiviridae of family
Begomovirus.
•	 The BGYMV isolates characterized so far have two molecules of single- stranded DNA
and a coat protein subunit.
•	 Characteristic ring-shaped viroplasms are
observed in the nuclei of infected plant cells.</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>BGYMV is transmitted by whitefly Bemisia
tabaci in a persistent manner.
•	 Adults can acquire the virus in as little time
as 6 minutes.
•	 BGYMV is retained for days or weeks and
through the moult.
•	 It does not multiply in the vector and is not
transmitted directly to progeny.
•	 Non-vector transmission is by mechanical
inoculation through grafting, but not by
contact between plants. </p>
<p>The virus is not transmitted through seed or
pollen.
•	 The common source of inoculum is adjacent
bean crops or leguminous weeds.
•	 BGYMV epidemics occur during dry and
warm (from December to April) conditions
that favor whitefly reproduction and
movement.
•	 A number of horticultural crops such as
Tomato, Brinjal, Broccoli, Soybean and
Tobacco act as reproductive hosts for B.
tabaci</p>

<h4>OKRA YELLOW VEIN MOSAIC VIRUS (YVMV)
</h4>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Leaves of infected plants show yellowish
mosaics, prominent yellow veins and leaf
curling.
•	 In extreme cases, the leaves become totally
yellow with no trace of green color.</p>
<p>If infection is severe plants become stunted.
•	 The fruits of the infected plants are pale
yellow, deformed, small and tough in texture.
•	 Hence, fruits will have reduced marketability
and palatability</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>Yellow vein mosaic virus disease (YVMV) is
one of the very important and destructive
diseases affecting Okra. It is transmitted by whitefly (Bemisia tabaci).
•	 The disease infects the crop at all stages of
growth and severely reduces the growth and
yield.</p>

<h4>CUCUMBER MOSAIC VIRUS (CMV)</h4>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>Prominent yellow mosaic pattern of light and
dark green (or yellow and green) appears on
the leaves.
•	 Malformation of leaves or growing points
and drastic reduction of leaf size and stem
internodes is also seen.</p>
<p>Flowers of severely affected plants may have
prominent abnormalities and greenish petals.
•	 CMV also causes severe stunting of the
plants, reduced yield and malformed fruits.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>CMV is a member of cucumovirus group
characterized by the three singlestranded
messenger-sense RNA molecules designated
RNA1, RNA 2 and RNA3.
•	 Each RNA molecule is encapsidated
separately as a single particle.</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>The virus has a broad host range with
many weeds and cultivated crops acting as
reservoirs of CMV.
•	 Non persistent transmission of the virus
by more than 60 Aphid species has been
reported, of which, Myzus persicae,
Macrosiphum euphorbiae and Aulacorthum
solani are among the more efficient ones.</p>
<p>Aphids acquire the virus within a minute, but
their ability to transmit the virus declines and
is lost within 2 hours.
•	 Efficiency of transmission also depends on
several factors such as vector biotype, virus
strain and environmental conditions.
•	 CMV is easily transmitted mechanically and
is also seed-borne in some plant species
other than cucurbits.</p>

<h4>Papaya Ring Spot Virus</h4>
<p>PRSV is the most destructive pathogen of
Papaya.
•	 There are two strains of the virus. </p>
<p>PRSV - type P that infects Papaya and
Cucurbits, and
•	 PRSV- type W that infects only Cucurbits. </p>
<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>The disease symptoms appear on leaves,
stems and fruits.
•	 Leaves become mottled with intense yellow
and green patterns and are much smaller
than normal.
•	 Margin and distal parts of leaves roll
downward and inwards resulting in shoe
string appearance.
•	 Older leaves show dark green streaks on the leaf stalks and stems.
•	 Plants may be stunted with fewer fruits than
normal, but they rarely die from infection.
•	 Early infection leads to no fruit formation.
•	 Fruits of infected plants are malformed and
show characteristic ring spots.
•	 The disease also affects the taste and flavor
of the fruit.</p>
<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>PRSV is a potyvirus belonging to the family
Potyviridae.
•	 The virus is a non-enveloped, flexous rodshaped particle having singlestranded RNA.
•	 The size of the virus particle varies between
760–800 nm long and 12 nm in diameter</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>Spread of the disease occurs when infected
plants are moved from nurseries to
plantations and through aphids, principally
the green peach aphid, in a non-persistent
way.
•	 Other aphids found to transmit PRSV are the
Melon aphid, Corn leaf aphid, Potato aphid
and Cow pea aphid.
•	 The aphid acquires the virus on its mouth
parts after a short feed on an infected plant
(less than a minute), infects a healthy plant
by another short feed, and consequently loses the ability to infect.</p>
<p>Papaya is not the preferred host for aphids.
•	 They are found more abundantly on alternate
hosts of PRSV (Cucurbits) than on Papaya.
•	 On Papaya they feed, move on, feed again,
and in the process spread the virus very
quickly.
•	 PRSV can also spread by mechanical means,
such as tools contaminated with sap of
infected plants, but this is not an important
method of transmission.</p>

<h4>BANANA BUNCHY TOP VIRUS (BBTV)</h4>
<p>Bunchy top of Banana is one of the serious
diseases of banana, which is extremely
difficult to eradicate or manage. </p>
<p>Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV) is
widespread in Southeast Asia, Philippines,
Taiwan, most of the South Pacific islands
and parts of India and Africa.</p>

<h5>Symptoms</h5>
<p>•	 Initially dark green streaks appear in the
veins of lower portions of leaf midrib and the
leaf stem.
•	 Infected plants are dwarfed and their
emerging leaves become small and narrow
with brittle, yellow (chlorotic) edges. </p>
<p>The stunted leaves grow upright and appear
bunched rendering the name ‘bunchy top’ to
the disease.
•	 Severely infected plants seldom fruit, and
when fruits are produced, the banana hands
and fingers are likely to be distorted.</p>

<h5>Pathogen Morphology</h5>
<p>Banana bunchy top virus is a multipartite
single stranded DNA virus of the genus
Babuvirus, which belongs to the family
Nanovirideae.</p>

<h5>Epidemiology</h5>
<p>All banana cultivars are susceptible to this
virus disease, Cavendish being relatively
more susceptible than others.
•	 The virus is transmitted by a single aphid
species, the banana aphid Pentalonia
nigronervosa and the incidence and spread is
high during hot and dry seasons.</p>
<p>The mode of transmission is persistent and
the aphid accounts for the spread of virus
over short distances, particularly within a
plantation.
•	 Infected planting material (suckers & tissue
culture plants) are almost certainly the means
by which BBTV moves long distances.</p>

<h4>Management of Viral Diseases</h4>
<p>Virus diseases are very difficult to control and
can result in substantial crop losses.
•	 Their incidence and severity vary from
season to season because of the complex
interrelationships that exist among the
pathogen, host, vector, virus source, and
environment.
•	 These diseases are not amenable to control
by direct methods.
•	 There is no chemical treatment that directly
interferes and controls the viral diseases.
•	 Unlike fungicides and bactericides,
commercial viricides for plant protection
have not yet been developed.
•	 A number of indirect control measures have
been developed for different crop plant-virus pathosystems and varied agro ecosystems
with an aim to avoid the pathogen or to
minimize their impact on crop yields.</p>
<p>As viruses routinely cause systemic
infections and have very effective methods
of transmission, preventing their spread has
become a complicated problem.
•	 Most plant viruses are transmitted by insects
and thus are widely dispersed in nature.
•	 Control of insect vectors is the only method
to minimize the spread of the virus disease.
•	 No single method will provide adequate
control, but using a combination (integrated)
of control options can often be effective.
•	 Therefore prevention is the best strategy. 
</p>

<h4>General Guidelines</h4>
<p>Use virus-resistant/tolerant varieties, if
available.
•	 Use virus-free seed, seedlings, tubers or
other planting material.
•	 Keep the fields free of weeds and remnants
of earlier crops that harbor virus and vectors.
•	 Avoid overlapping crops and side-by-side
planting especially in continuous cropping.
•	 Install sticky traps (Yellow & Blue) @15-20/
acre to control the insect population.
•	 Use tall non-host barrier crops (Maize and
Sorghum) around the plot to reduce the
number of insects entering the crop.
•	 Remove and destroy plants showing
symptoms, early in the life of the crop, to
reduce spread.
•	 Use disinfectants to wash farm equipment,
footwear and hands to avoid the spread of
contact transmissible viruses.
•	 Break the virus disease cycle by growing a
non-host crop to remove the source of virus
infection.</p>
<p>Use systemic insecticides to control insect
vectors and reduce speed of spread of virus.
•	 Spray systemic insecticides like
o	 Imidacloprid 30.5% SC (Confidor Super)
@ 0.3 ml/ltr. or
o	 Diafenthiuron 50% WP (Pegasus) @1 gm/
ltr. or
o	 Acetamiprid 20% SP (Rekord/Pride) @
0.3 gm/ltr. or
o	 Ethiprole and Imidacloprid 40% + 40% WG
(Glamore) @ 0.4 gm/ltr. or
o	 Thiamethoxam 25% WG (Actara/Anant)
@ 0.5 gm/ltr. or
o	 Acephate 75% SP (Starthene/Asataf)
@ 1.5 gm/ltr.
•	 Spray the seedlings with any one of the above
insecticides 1-2 days before transplanting to
protect them from all sucking pests including
thrips and whiteflies for a period of up to 15-
20 days.
•	 Incidence of Bud necrosis virus can also be
reduced by treating seeds with Imidacloprid,
intercropping with fast growing cereals and
use of silver color mulch.</p>

<h5>Recent Findings in Management of Virus Diseases</h5>
<p>Till recently, in case of virus diseases, it was
only prevention and no cure.
•	 However, recent progress in the management
of virus diseases is the introduction of a plant
extract based product called ‘Power Plus’.
•	 Power Plus empowers the plants to fight
against virus through eliciting their innate
resistance mechanism.
•	 It is both preventive and curative in nature.
•	 Regular spray of Power Plus makes
the plants not only to prevent but also to
overcome the virus infection.
•	 In addition, it also improves organoleptic
properties like color, taste and flavor of the
fruits.
•	 It is systemic and compatible with most of
the pesticides and nutrients.
•	 Spraying Power Plus-1 alternating with
Power Plus-2, in the following combinations,
at 10 days intervals, ensures complete
recovery of infected plants and restricts
further spread of the disease.</p>
<p>1. Power Plus-1 (5 ml/ltr) + Calcium Nitrate
(5 gm/ltr) + one of the insecticides listed
under general guidelines above.
2. Power Plus-2 (5 ml/ltr) + Potassium
Nitrate (5 gm/ltr).
•	 This has become the most successful treatment
against Papaya Ring Spot Virus in Papaya in
India.
•	 Power Plus is also shown to be effective
against a wide range of virus diseases
including Tomato Leaf Curl, BGMV in Beans
and CMV in Chillies & Cucurbits, a poty
virus in Orchids, etc.
•	 Its broad spectrum activity remains to be
tested against other viruses in various crops.
•	 Pictures given below are the proofs for the
performance of Power Plus in Papaya and
other crops.</p>
