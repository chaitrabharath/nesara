<h2>Diseases</h2>
<h3>Virus Diseases</h3>
<p>Viruses are small infectious agents that
need the host for their survival, growth and
reproduction.
•	 They can infect all types of life forms, from
animals and plants to microorganisms,
including bacteria and archaea.
•	 As pathogens, viruses are always intracellular,
moving from cell to cell throughout the plant
by way of plasmodesmata and vascular
transport systems, most commonly the
phloem.
•	 While some viruses, such as Cucumber
Mosaic virus, die quickly if outside a cell or if
the cell dies, other viruses such as Tobacco
Mosaic virus retain their ability to infect for
years after the infected plant part dies.
•	 Many different viruses can infect plants and
disease spreads from infected plant to healthy
plants by the following ways.
o	 Mechanically by way of contaminated
workers’ hands, tools and equipment.
o	 Majority of the plant viral diseases are
spread by insect vectors like Aphids,
Thrips, Whitefly, Leafhopper, Mite or
Nematodes.
o	 And also through grafting.
