<h2>Diseases</h2>
<h3>Seed-borne Diseases</h3>
<p>•	 The diseases that are of the seeds and
carried through the seeds are called Seedborne diseases.
•	 Seed-borne diseases are caused by
Oomycetes, fungi, bacteria, viruses and
nematodes.
•	 All true/vegetative seeds are infected by the
above pathogens.
•	 The seed primordium or the maturing seed
may be infected either
(a) Directly from the infected plant through
the flower or fruit stalk and the seed stalk
or directly from the seed surface, or
(b) Infection from outside may be introduced
through stigma or ovary wall or pericarp,
and the flower or fruit stalk, and later
through the seed coat.
•	 A pathogen may penetrate several of these
parts of the seed (seed coat, endosperm and
embryo) and in turn infect them.
•	 The infestation/contamination of the seed
may occur during harvesting, threshing,
processing and storage.
•	 The pathogen may, thus, be carried with the
seeds in three ways.
(a) Admixture: Pathogens are independent
of seeds but accompany them. e.g.,
Sclerotia of Ergot get mixed with healthy
seeds during threshing.
(b) External: Pathogen may be present on
seed surface as spores, oospores and
chlamydospores as in case of Karnal
bunt of Wheat, covered smut of Barley,
downy mildew of Pearl millet, etc.
(c) Internal: Pathogens establish within
the seed with definite relationship with
seed parts.
•	 Seed-borne diseases/pathogens can spread
from the seed and infect the new plant in
several ways.
•	 Upon sowing, moisture activates pathogens
causing pre and post emergence dampingoff.
•	 Some of the pathogens like different
species of Fusarium, Pythium, Rhizoctonia,
Sclerotinia, Alternaria also cause similar
diseases in several other crops.
•	 All seed transmitted diseases are seedborne, but all seed-borne diseases are not
seed transmitted.</p>

<h5>Damage Caused</h5>
<p><h5>1. Disease transmission</h5>
•	 Seed-borne pathogens transmit diseases
between fields, regions and countries
through seed and other planting material.
e.g., diseases like Bacterial blight of Rice,
Sclerotinia diseases of Broad Beans,
Common Beans and recently Cauliflower are
transmitted through movement of improved
seed.
•	 Importance of transmission can be realized
when we know the seeding rate (kg/ha),
percentage seed infection and number
of infected seeds/kg of seed for e.g., in
case of Loose Smut of Wheat and Barley,
0.1% seed infection brings in 5000
infected seeds/hectare of field, which give
rise to equal number of infected plants
(systemic) and in such cases yield losses
are expected in the same ratio of 1:1.
<h5>2. Complete loss or reduction in seed
germination</h5>
•	 Macrophomina phaseolina infection in Bean
seeds causes 59% loss of germination.
•	 Cercospora kikuchii infection in Soybean
causes 12% loss of germination.
•	 Seed-borne smut fungi in a number of cereals
and Pigeonpea Sterility Mosaic Virus cause
severe seed abortion resulting in 80 to 100%
yield losses.
<h5>3. Reduction in seed quality</h5>
•	 Infections by pathogen often substantially
reduce seed size and weight reduction, e.g.,
Leaf blight of Sunflower caused by Alternaria
helianthi, A. zinnniae causing up to 80%
yield loss.
•	 Species of Aspergillus, Fusarium, Diplodia,
Botryodiplodia, Nigrospora, Tinfect standing
Maize causing seed rot.
•	 Sclerotisation, stromatisation and gall
formation e.g., Claviceps fusiformis causing
stromatisation of millet seeds leading to 60-
70% yield loss, Anguina tritici causing seed
galls in Wheat.
•	 Seed discoloration is a very important and
wide spread symptom produced on seed
indicating presence of pathogen, resulting in
reduction in market value e.g., Cercospora
kikuchii in Soy bean, Fusarium moniliformae
in Sorghum, Aschochyta pisi in sweet pea.
•	 Infected seeds may also be contami-nated
with mycotoxins and nutritional changes.
•	 Biochemical changes in seed products. e.g.,
Groundnuts infected with A. flavus gives
inferior quality of oil through reduction of
the refractive index.
<h5>4. Reduction in yield:</h5> Great yield losses are
experienced worldwide through seed-borne
pathogens.</p>

<h5>Management of seed-borne diseases</h5>
<p>•	 Take up seed production in diseasefree areas.
o	 Choose dry areas with low humidity and
irrigation facilities.
o	 Schedule the time of planting to avoid
disease incidence.
o	 Isolate seed crop from fields containing
possibly diseased plants.
•	 Good production practices.
o	 Use certified seed.
o	 Minimize plant stress - fertilization &
irrigation.
o	 Manage weeds effectively.
o	 Select well drained soils.
o	 Follow a seed rate that ensures proper
plant density to promote rapid drying of
foliage.
o	 Destroy/ plough under the crop residues.
o	 Practise proper crop handling (wash
hands & implements).
o	 Remove infected plants (rouging).
o	 Avoid working in field when wet.
•	 Eradicate disease-causing pathogen
from production area.
o	 Remove alternate hosts and volunteer
host plants.
o	 Rotate crop and follow sanitation - residue
management.
o	 Create conditions unfavorable to
pathogens.
o	 Adopt seed treatment.
o	 Use resistant/ tolerant crop varieties.
o	 Use disease-free planting materials.
o	 Spray protective fungicides.
o	 Control Insect vectors.
•	 Isolation and Field Inspection.
o	 Seed crops should be isolated from all
sources of pollen contamination and
seed-borne diseases.
o	 Crop should be inspected at least once at
appropriate stage of growth.
o	 At least 20% of the crops of certified seed
should be inspected.
o	 Presence of any seed-borne disease
should be at the lowest possible level.</p>

<h5>Seed Treatment</h5>
<p>•	 Seed treatment refers to the application
of fungicide, insecticide, or a combination
of both, to seeds so as to disinfect and
disinfest them from seed-borne or soil-borne
pathogenic organisms and storage insects.
•	 It also refers to the exposing seeds to solar
energy, immersing in conditioned water, etc.
Benefits of Seed Treatment
•	 Prevents spread of plant diseases that are
seed-borne and seed transmitted.
•	 Prevents seed rot and seedling blights.
•	 Improves seed germination.
•	 Provides protection from storage insects and
sucking insects at early stages.
•	 Prevents damage by soil inhabiting insects.
Types of Seed Treatment
1) Seed disinfection
•	 Seed disinfection refers to the eradication
of fungal spores that have become
established within the seed coat, or deeper
tissues.
•	 For effective control, the fungicide must
actually penetrate the seed in order to kill
the fungus.
2) Seed disinfestation
•	 Seed disinfestation refers to the destruction
of surface-borne organisms that have
contaminated the seed surface but not
infected the seed surface.
•	 Chemical dips, soaks, fungicides applied
as dust, slurry or liquid have been found
successful.
3) Seed protection
•	The purpose of seed protection is to protect
the seed and young seedling from organisms
in the soil, which might otherwise cause
decay of the seed before germination.
Conditions under which seeds must be
treated
1) Injured Seeds
•	 Seeds suffer mechanical injury during
combining and threshing operations, or
from being dropped from excessive heights.
•	 They may also be injured by weather or
improper storage.
•	 Any break in the seed coat affords an
excellent opportunity for the pathogen to
enter the seed and either kill it, or weaken
the seedling that will grow from it.
2) Diseased seed
•	 Seeds may get infected by disease causing
organisms even at the time of harvest, during
processing, if processed on contaminated
machinery or if stored in contaminated
containers or warehouses.
3) Undesirable soil conditions
•	 Seeds are sometimes planted under
unfavorable soil conditions such as cold and
damp soils or extremely dry soils.
•	 Such conditions could be favorable to the
growth and development of certain fungi
enabling them to attack and damage the
seeds.
4) Disease-free seed
•	 Seeds are invariably infected by disease
causing organisms, ranging from those
having no economic consequence to those
causing severe economic consequences.
•	 Seed treatment provides insurance against
seed transmitted diseases, soil-borne
organisms and thus affords protection to
weak seeds enabling them to germinate in to
healthy seedlings.
</p>
<h5>Precautions in Seed Treatment:</h5>
<p>•	 Most products used in the treatment of seeds
are harmful to humans.
•	 Extreme care is required to ensure that
treated seeds are never used as human or
animal food.
•	 Treated seeds should be clearly labeled as
being dangerous, if consumed.
•	 The possibilities of unsold treated seeds
being used for human or animal feed can
be reduced, if care is taken to treat only the
quantities that are expected to be sold.
•	 Care must also be taken to treat seeds with
correct dosage of the formulation. Applying
in excess or too little can be as damaging as
not treating at all.
•	 Seeds with higher moisture content are more
susceptible to injury when treated with some
of the concentrated liquid products.
•	 If seeds are to be treated with bacterial
cultures, the sequence of treatment should
be,
i. Chemical treatments
ii. Insecticide and fungicide treatments
iii. Special treatments</p>

<h5>Fungicides used in seed treatment</h5>
<p>Thiram, Captan Commonly used broad spectrum contact fungicides.
Carbendazim (Bavistin), Thiophanate

water. Dip for 15-20 minutes and dry the
tubers in shade before planting.
For spraying on tubers:
• Dissolve 200 gm Vitavax Power in 5 ltr water.
Spray uniformly on the tubers and dry under
shade before planting.
Seed treatment with bio-agents:
• Seeds can also be treated with bio-control
agents like Trichoderma viride, T. harzianum,
T. koningii, T. hamatum, Pseudomonas
fluorescens etc., to protect them against
seed-borne and soil-borne diseases.
Dosage:
Vegetable seeds:
• Mix 5 to 10 gm of formulation in 1 kg seed.
Field crops:
• Mix 100 to 500 gm of formulation with the
quantity of seeds required for one acre.
Sugarcane and tuber crops (Onion, Potato,
etc.):
• Mix 2.0 kg of formulation with seed material
required for one acre.
Note: Follow the recommendation of the
manufacturers of the products.
Method of application:
•	 Make a paste or slurry by mixing 5 gm of the
formulation in 1 litre of water or Rice gruel.
•	 Pour 1kg of seed on to the paste or slurry and
mix thoroughly to coat the seeds uniformly.
•	 Shade dry the coated seeds for 20-30
minutes before sowing.</p>
