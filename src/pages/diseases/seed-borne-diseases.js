<h2>Diseases</h2>
<h3>Seed-borne Diseases</h3>
<p>•	 The diseases that are of the seeds and
carried through the seeds are called Seedborne diseases.
•	 Seed-borne diseases are caused by
Oomycetes, fungi, bacteria, viruses and
nematodes.
•	 All true/vegetative seeds are infected by the
above pathogens.
•	 The seed primordium or the maturing seed
may be infected either
(a) Directly from the infected plant through
the flower or fruit stalk and the seed stalk
or directly from the seed surface, or
(b) Infection from outside may be introduced
through stigma or ovary wall or pericarp,
and the flower or fruit stalk, and later
through the seed coat.
•	 A pathogen may penetrate several of these
parts of the seed (seed coat, endosperm and
embryo) and in turn infect them.
•	 The infestation/contamination of the seed
may occur during harvesting, threshing,
processing and storage.
•	 The pathogen may, thus, be carried with the
seeds in three ways.
(a) Admixture: Pathogens are independent
of seeds but accompany them. e.g.,
Sclerotia of Ergot get mixed with healthy
seeds during threshing.
(b) External: Pathogen may be present on
seed surface as spores, oospores and
chlamydospores as in case of Karnal
bunt of Wheat, covered smut of Barley,
downy mildew of Pearl millet, etc.
(c) Internal: Pathogens establish within
the seed with definite relationship with
seed parts.
•	 Seed-borne diseases/pathogens can spread
from the seed and infect the new plant in
several ways.
•	 Upon sowing, moisture activates pathogens
causing pre and post emergence dampingoff.
•	 Some of the pathogens like different
species of Fusarium, Pythium, Rhizoctonia,
Sclerotinia, Alternaria also cause similar
diseases in several other crops.
•	 All seed transmitted diseases are seedborne, but all seed-borne diseases are not
seed transmitted.</p>

<h5>Damage Caused</h5>
<p><h5>1. Disease transmission</h5>
•	 Seed-borne pathogens transmit diseases
between fields, regions and countries
through seed and other planting material.
e.g., diseases like Bacterial blight of Rice,
Sclerotinia diseases of Broad Beans,
Common Beans and recently Cauliflower are
transmitted through movement of improved
seed.
•	 Importance of transmission can be realized
when we know the seeding rate (kg/ha),
percentage seed infection and number
of infected seeds/kg of seed for e.g., in
case of Loose Smut of Wheat and Barley,
0.1% seed infection brings in 5000
infected seeds/hectare of field, which give
rise to equal number of infected plants
(systemic) and in such cases yield losses
are expected in the same ratio of 1:1.
<h5>2. Complete loss or reduction in seed
germination</h5>
•	 Macrophomina phaseolina infection in Bean
seeds causes 59% loss of germination.
•	 Cercospora kikuchii infection in Soybean
causes 12% loss of germination.
•	 Seed-borne smut fungi in a number of cereals
and Pigeonpea Sterility Mosaic Virus cause
severe seed abortion resulting in 80 to 100%
yield losses.
<h5>3. Reduction in seed quality</h5>
•	 Infections by pathogen often substantially
reduce seed size and weight reduction, e.g.,
Leaf blight of Sunflower caused by Alternaria
helianthi, A. zinnniae causing up to 80%
yield loss.
•	 Species of Aspergillus, Fusarium, Diplodia,
Botryodiplodia, Nigrospora, Tinfect standing
Maize causing seed rot.
•	 Sclerotisation, stromatisation and gall
formation e.g., Claviceps fusiformis causing
stromatisation of millet seeds leading to 60-
70% yield loss, Anguina tritici causing seed
galls in Wheat.
•	 Seed discoloration is a very important and
wide spread symptom produced on seed
indicating presence of pathogen, resulting in
reduction in market value e.g., Cercospora
kikuchii in Soy bean, Fusarium moniliformae
in Sorghum, Aschochyta pisi in sweet pea.
•	 Infected seeds may also be contami-nated
with mycotoxins and nutritional changes.
•	 Biochemical changes in seed products. e.g.,
Groundnuts infected with A. flavus gives
inferior quality of oil through reduction of
the refractive index.
<h5>4. Reduction in yield:</h5> Great yield losses are
experienced worldwide through seed-borne
pathogens.</p>
