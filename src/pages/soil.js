    <h3>Soil and Fertilizer</h3>
    <p>Man cannot exist without soil.</p>
<p>Soil may be defined as a thin layer of earth crust that supports growth of land plants.</p>
<p>Soil is a living body full of activity rather than just an inert mixture of sand and clay.</p>
<p>Soils consist of minerals, organic materials and differ in morphology, physical make-up, chemical composition and biological characteristics.</p>
<p>Soil provides plants the physical support and meets their needs of water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Soils need to be scientifically managed forsustained crop production over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Soil properties decide the nature of conversion, conservation of nutrients, and how they are made available to the plants.</p>
