    <h3>Soil and Fertilizer</h3>
    <ControlledCarousel/>
    <p>Man cannot exist without soil.</p>
<p>Soil may be defined as a thin layer of earth crust that supports growth of land plants.</p>
<p>Soil is a living body full of activity rather than just an inert mixture of sand and clay.</p>
<p>Soils consist of minerals, organic materials and differ in morphology, physical make-up, chemical composition and biological characteristics.</p>
<p>Soil provides plants the physical support and meets their needs of water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Soils need to be scientifically managed forsustained crop production over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Soil properties decide the nature of conversion, conservation of nutrients, and how they are made available to the plants.</p>

<p><strong>Soil Types</strong></p>
<p><em>1. Alluvial soils (Entisols)</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>These are most important from agriculture point of view.</li>
    <li>Alluvial soils are formed mainly due to silt deposited by rivers.</li>
    <li>In coastal regions, some alluvial deposits are formed due to wave action.</li>
    <li>The parent material of these soils is of transported origin.</li>
    <li>The soil is porous because it has about equal proportions of sand and clay (loamy), but clayey soils are not uncommon.</li>
    <li>While they are generally low in Nitrogen, the proportion of Potash, Phosphoric Acid and alkalies are adequate.</li>
    <li>They are best suited to irrigation and respond well to canal and well/tube-well irrigation.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em>2. Black soils (Vertisols)</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>A typical black soil has a high clay content of 62% or more.</li>
    <li>The black soils have high moisture retention capacity, and are generally neutral to slightly alkaline.</li>
    <li>When dry, soil shrinks and develops deep cracks permitting oxygenation of the soil to sufficient depths and thus enhancing fertility.</li>
    <li>The black colour is due to the presence of a small proportion of Titaniferous Magnetite or Iron and black constituents of the parent rock.</li>
    <li>They generally contain 10% Alumina, 9-10% Iron Oxide, 6-8% lime and Magnesium Carbonates, less than 0.5% Potash and are low in Phosphates, Nitrogen and humus.</li>
    <li>This soil has been used for growing a variety of crops for centuries without adding fertilizers and manures.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em>3. Red soils (Alfisols)</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>The main parent rocks are crystalline and metamorphic rocks.</li>
    <li>The red colour is due to the presence of oxides of Iron.</li>
    <li>The texture of these soils can vary from sand to clay, the majority being loams.</li>
    <li>On the uplands, the red soils are poor, gravelly and porous.</li>
    <li>But in the lower areas they are rich, deep dark and fertile.</li>
    <li>They are mostly acidic and are poor in lime, Magnesium, Phosphates, Nitrogen and humus.</li>
    <li>They are fairly rich in Potassium.</li>
    <li>The red soils are mostly loamy and hence cannot retain water unlike the black soils.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em>4. Laterite soils (Oxisols)</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Laterite soils are mostly the end products of weathering, formed under high temperatures and high rainfall with alternate wet and dry periods.</li>
    <li>Laterite soils are red in color due to little clay and more gravel of red sand-stones.</li>
    <li>Lime and Silica are leached away in heavy rainfall, but the soil is rich in oxides of Iron and Aluminium compounds.</li>
    <li>They are very poor in lime, Magnesium, Potash and Nitrogen.</li>
    <li>Sometimes, the Phosphate content may be high in the form of Iron Phosphate.</li>
    <li>Laterite soils lack fertility due to intensive leaching.</li>
    <li>When manured and irrigated, some laterites are suitable for growing plantation crops like Tea, Coffee, Rubber, Cinchona, Coconut, Arecanut, etc.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em>5. Forest-Mountain soils</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>They are mainly heterogeneous soils found on the hill slopes covered by forests.</li>
    <li>The formation of these soils is mainly governed by the characteristic deposition of organic matter derived from forests and their character changes with parent rocks, ground-configuration and climate.</li>
    <li>The forest soils are very rich in humus and are mostly acidic.</li>
    <li>They are deficient in Potash, Phosphorus and lime.</li>
    <li>They require good deal of fertilizers for high yields.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em>6. Arid-Desert soils</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>The desert soils consist of sand (90 - 95%) and clay (5 - 10%).</li>
    <li>They are usually poor in organic matter.</li>
    <li>Some desert soils are alkaline with varying degree of soluble salts like Calcium carbonate.</li>
    <li>Calcium content increases downwards with the subsoil having ten times more Calcium.</li>
    <li>The Phosphate content of these soils is as high as in normal alluvial soils.</li>
    <li>Nitrogen is originally low but some of it is available in the form of Nitrates.</li>
    <li>Phosphates and Nitrates make these soils fertile wherever moisture is available.</li>
    <li>There is a possibility of reclaiming these soils if proper irrigation facilities are available.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em>7. Saline-Alkaline soils</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>They show white incrustation of salts of Calcium, Magnesium and Sodium on the surface.</li>
    <li>These are poor in drainage and are infertile.</li>
    <li>In regions with low water table, the salts percolate into sub-soil and in regions with good drainage, the salts are wasted away by flowing water.</li>
    <li>But in places where the drainage system is poor, the water with high salt concentration becomes stagnant and deposits all the salts in the top soil as it evaporates.</li>
    <li>In regions with high sub-soil water table, injurious salts are transferred from below by the capillary action as a result of evaporation in dry season.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em>8. Peaty and Marshy soils</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>These types of soils are found in coastal tracts.</li>
    <li>Accumulation of partly decayed organic matter over several years in the presence of high moisture gives rise to peaty and marshy soils.</li>
    <li>These are black in colour, heavy and highly acidic.</li>
    <li>When properly drained and fertilized, these soils produce good crops of rice.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>SOIL COMPOSITION</strong></p>

<p>An ideal soil is made of mineral matter (45-50%), organic matter (1-5%), air (25%) and water (25%).</p>

<p><em>1. Soil Mineral Matter</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Mineral matter is largely made up of Oxygen and Silicon.</li>
    <li>Most abundantly available plant nutrients are Iron, Potassium and Magnesium.</li>
    <li>The particulate size ranges from large pieces of gravel to coarse sand (2 - 0.2 mm) to fine clay (0.002 mm).</li>
    <li>The mineral matter determines the soil texture and its water holding capacity.</li>
    <li>Silt is a storehouse of nutrients, while clay along with organic matter is most active.</li>

</ul></p>

<p><em>2. Soil Organic Matter</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>The organic matter (OM) consists of a variety of (Bacteria, Fungi, Algae, Actinomycetes, etc.), animal life (Earthworms, Nematodes, Protozoa, Mites, Beetles, Moles, etc.), their excretions, debris of dead bodies decomposed to various extents.</li>
    <li>It ranges from less than 1% in many soils in the plains to 3-4% in forest and mountain soils.</li>
    <li>Average composition of OM is 47% C, 44% O, 7% H, 2% N and traces of other elements.</li>
    <li>It is the storehouse of nutrients, affects cation exchange, water retention, and fixation and release of nutrients.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em>3. Soil Water and Air</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Soil water that is also called Soil Solution, is the dilute solution containing small amounts of every soluble compound present in the soils.</li>
    <li>Soil water promotes physical and biological activities of soil, acts as solvent and carrier of nutrients and maintains turgidity of plants.</li>
    <li>Soil water transports nutrients to the root, to the soil surface or subsoil depending on the direction of water flow.</li>
    <li>Soil air is essential for most of the biological reactions in the soil.</li>
    <li>Soil air has about ten times more carbon dioxide than atmospheric air, due to respiration by roots and soil microorganisms.</li>
    <li>Soil air is the pathway for intake of oxygen that is absorbed by soil microorganisms and plant roots and for escape of Carbon dioxide produced by the plants.</li>
    <li>This process called soil aeration is critical for plant growth when water content is high and water replaces soil air.</li>

</ul></p>

<p><em>Major role of Organic matter</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Binds different soil particles.</li>
    <li>Increases rate of infiltration.</li>
    <li>Increases Water Holding Capacity (WHC).</li>
    <li>Increases ability to resist erosion.</li>
    <li>Acts as mulch.</li>
    <li>Reduces alkalinity.</li>
    <li>Increases Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC).</li>
    <li>Solubilizing effect on certain minerals.</li>
    <li>Store house of nutrients.</li>
    <li>Temporarily absorbs heavy metal pollutants.</li>
    <li>Source of energy for micro-organisms.</li>
    <li>Acts as chelate.</li>
    <li>Improves soil aeration.</li>

</ul></p>


<p><strong>SOIL PROPERTIES</strong></p>

<p><em>Soil Texture</em></p>
<p><ul>

    <li>Three categories of soil particles - sand, silt and clay are established based on their particle size.</li>
    <li>Clay particles are the smallest ( &lt;0.002 mm), while sand particles are the largest (0.05- 2.00 mm).</li>
    <li>Soil texture depends on the proportion of sand, silt and clay.</li>
    <li>There are 12 classes of soil texture.</li>
    <li>If most particles are large and coarse the soil is called Sand.</li>
    <li>Silt is dominated by medium-sized particles and feels like flour.</li>
    <li>Small-sized soil particles primarily make up a Clay soil.</li>

</ul></p>

<p><em>Soil water relations</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Soil texture and organic matter content determine its water holding capacity (WHC), rate of water intake, percolation, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), etc.</li>
    <li>WHC and CEC increase with increase in clay content and depth.</li>
    <li>Water intake and percolation increase with increase in the proportion of sand.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em>Field Capacity:</em></p>
<p>Maximum amount of water a soil holds after free drainage, e.g. 10% in sandy soils, 34% in loamy soils and 40% in clay soils.</p>

<p><em>Wilting point:</em></p>
<p>The amount of available water in the soil, below which plants start to wilt, e.g. 4% in sandy soils, 16% in loamy soils and 24% in clay soils.</p>

<p><em>Available water:</em></p>
<p>Water held by soil that is available for crop production i.e. FC - WP. e.g.. 6% in sandy soils, 18 % in loamy soils and 16% in clay soils.</p>

<p><em>Soil pH</em></p>
<p>
    Soil pH is a very important character that indicates whether the soil is acidic, alkaline or neutral. It is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) 
    activity and is measured on a 0-14 unit less scale. Soil pH influences the availability, retention and release of nutrients. The ideal pH for one nutrient need not be 
    ideal for another, making it impossible to attain maximum availability of all nutrients at a given pH. Most acceptable range of pH is between 5.5 and 7.5.
    Nitrogen, Potassium and Sulphur are relatively less affected by pH. Phosphorus is directly affected. H2PO4 reacts with Calcium and Magnesium ion in alkaline 
    soils and with Aluminium and Iron in acidic soils to form less soluble compounds. Most micronutrients, except Molybdenum, are less available at pH above 7.5.
    The low availability of a nutrient should be compensated by increasing its supply through manures and fertilizers.
    Liming of acid soils and treating alkali soils with Gypsum/ Pyrites is recommended to attain desirable pH range.
    Continuous use of acid forming fertilizers can cause deficiency of Calcium and Magnesium and also toxicity of Iron and Manganese.
</p>

<p><em>Soil Electrical Conductivity (EC)</em></p>

<p>
Electrical conductivity (EC) is the ability of an aqueous solution to carry an electric current. 
It is the most common measure of soil salinity. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) correlates with soil properties including texture, 
cation exchange capacity, drainage, organic matter level, salinity, and subsoil characteristics. 
Plants are detrimentally affected by excess salts in some soils and by high levels of exchangeable Sodium in others.
The electrical conductivity of soils varies depending on the amount of moisture held by soil particles.
Sands have a low conductivity, silts have a medium conductivity, and clays have a high conductivity. Na+.
Electrical Conductivity (EC) is commonly expressed in units of decisiemens/m.
</p>

<p><em>Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)</em></p>

<p>Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is the total of its negatively charged (mineral and organic) sites, which are able to hold cations.
    CEC is measured as meq/100 g (milli equivalents per 100 gm soil).
    Soils rich in clay and organic matter exhibit maximum CEC.
    Moderate to high CEC soils are desired since they hold more cations and minimize leaching.
    The cation exchange is governed by the charge, reactivity and concentration. e.g. Al+++ > Ca++ > Mg++ > K+
    = NH4+ > H+ > Na+. CEC increases with increase in soil pH.
</p>

<p><em>Anion Exchange Capacity (AEC)</em></p>
<p>It is the opposite of CEC, consisting of positively charged sites that can hold and release anions.
    Clays, organic matter and hydroxides provide for AEC. AEC is much smaller and less important
    compared to CEC. There is a fair degree of order in which anions are held on to +ve sites, 
    e.g. H2PO4- > SO4 - > NO3- > Cl-. While Phosphate is held most tightly, Nitrates and Chlorides are held weakly.
</p>

<p><strong>SOIL FERTILITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND HEALTH</strong></p>
<p><em>Soil Fertility and Productivity</em></p>
<p>Soil fertility and productivity is the ability of soil to sustain agricultural plant growth. 
    It is the ability to supply essential plant nutrients and water in adequate amounts 
    and proportions for plant growth and reproduction. Conventionally, soil fertility is referred to as
    soil health. So, a Soil Health Card (SHC) contains information on the nutrient contents of the
    soil, pH, EC and Organic Carbon, and does not reflect the actual health of the soil.
</p>

<p><em>Soil health</em></p>
<p>
    Soil health is not soil fertility alone. All cultivable soils harbor both useful and
    harmful organisms. When soil-borne fungi, bacteria, nematodes, protozoa, are present, individually 
    or in combination, above the threshold level, it is called ‘Sick Soil’. Hence, all fertile and productive soils need
    not necessarily be ‘healthy soils’. All healthy soils need not be fertile and productive either.
    Several soil-borne pathogens like Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, Verticillium, Phytophthora, Pythium, Meloidogyne, Heterodera, etc.,
    thrive well in certain soils and cause severe crop diseases. Such soils are called Conducive soils.
    Whereas, the same pathogens develop much less and cause milder disease in certain other soils called the Suppressive soils.
    In most cases the primary reason for a soil being suppressive is the presence of one or several microorganisms antagonistic to the pathogens.
</p>

<p><em>Management practices to improve soil fertility, productivity and health</em></p>
<p>1. Reduce Tillage</p>
<p>Excessive tillage increases oxygen in the
soil, stimulates microbial activity, and results
in the decomposition of organic matter. Tillage also disrupts soil aggregates,
exposing particles of organic matter that
were otherwise protected from microbial
consumption. If additions of organic matter are not
sufficient to counteract the losses from
decomposition, organic matter levels will
decline over time, reducing soil health. Inversion tillage also reduces the soil
coverage provided by crop residues, leaving
soil more exposed to erosion. Tillage can also disrupt the hyphal network
of Mycorrhizal fungi, which can lead to their
decline over time.</p>

<p>2. Reduce Soil Compaction</p>
<p>Soil compaction occurs when soil is exposed to excessive human and equipment traffic 
    while the soil is wet and plastic. Compaction results in reduction of pore 
    space and increased bulk density, leading to poor water infiltration and drainage and
    increased runoff. Soil compaction increases soil hardness,
    making it more difficult for plant roots to grow through the soil. 
    Compaction and removal of surface residue may contribute to reduction in soil moisture 
    and living space for soil-dwelling organisms.
</p>

<p>3. Increase organic matter inputs</p>
<p>
The inputs of organic matter must meet or exceed the losses of organic matter due to decomposition.
Healthy crops can be a valuable source of organic matter, and crop residues should be returned to the soil to the extent possible.
Incorporation of cover crops or perennial crops and judicious additions of green manure, green leaf manure and compost
can also be used to increase or maintain soil organic matter.
</p>

<p>4. Use cover crops</p>
<p>
    Cover crops keep the soil covered during
    periods of time when crops have not formed
    a good canopy, reducing the risk of erosion.
The biomass produced by cover crops is
usually returned to the soil, enhancing
organic matter levels.
Cover crops with taproots can create
macropores and alleviate compaction.
Species of cover crops that host mycorrhizal
fungi can sustain and increase the population
of these beneficial fungi.
Legume cover crops can add Nitrogen to the
soil through Nitrogen fixation.
Cover crops can retain nitrate and other
nutrients that are susceptible to leaching
losses.
</p>

<p>5. Reduce pesticide use and provide habitat for beneficial organisms</p>
<p>
    Beneficial insects that contribute to biological control or pest organisms can be harmed 
    by the application of broad-spectrum insecticides. Avoid indiscriminate use of pesticides that
    also kill non-target and beneficial insects. 
</p>

<p>6. Rotate Crops</p>
<p>Diverse crop rotations will help break up soil-borne pest and pathogen life cycles, improving crop health. •	 Rotations can also assist in managing weeds.
    Rotating crops can also help reduce nutrient excesses.
</p>

<p>7. Manage Nutrients</p>
<p>Minimise nutrient excess by carefully
planning the timing, application method,
and quantity of manure, compost, and other
fertilizers. Over-fertilizing can increase pest problems.
Increasing soluble Nitrogen levels in plants
can decrease their resistance to pests,
resulting in higher pest density and crop
damage. Maintain soil pH appropriate for the crop
to improve nutrient availability and reduce
toxicity. Maintain adequate Calcium levels to
help earthworms thrive and improve soil
aggregation. Use diverse nutrient sources, which help in
maintaining soil fertility. Manure and compost add organic matter as
well as an array of nutrients. But using just
compost or manure to meet the Nitrogen
needs of the crop every year can result in
excessive Phosphorus levels in the soil. Combine modest manure or compost
additions to meet Phosphorus needs with
additional Nitrogen inputs from legume cover
or forage crops in a crop rotation to balance
both Nitrogen and Phosphorus inputs.
</p>

<p>8. Add beneficial organisms</p>
<p>Add bio-control agents like Trichoderma viride, Trichoderma harzianum,
Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, Fusarium proliferatum (against fungi), 
Bacillus firmus, Paecilomyces lilacinus 
(against nematodes), for control of soilborne pathogens. 
Add bio-fertilizers like Nitrogen fixing bacteria, Phosphorus solubilizing bacteria,
Potassium mobilizing bacteria, Ferrous mobilizing bacteria, Zinc mobilizing bacteria, 
Sulphur mobilizing bacteria, Manganese 
solubilizing microbe, Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhizae (VAM), etc. 
Jeevamrutha may also be added periodically to maintain the beneficial micro-organisms
in the soil. Jeevamrutha, provides a congenial environment to soil microorganisms that
play an important role in making available essential nutrients for plant growth viz.,
Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium to the plants. It encourages microbial activity in the soil
and improves soil health considerably.
</p>

<p><em>Green manuring & Green leaf manuring</em></p>

<p>
    Green manuring is an efficient way of increasing organic matter in the soil. 
    It is the practice of growing plants usually belonging to leguminous family
    and incorporating them into the soil after sufficient growth. An ideal green manure crop should be
    inexpensive to plant, easily to establish, produce succulent tops and roots rapidly, 
    generate good ground cover quickly and capable of growing on poor soils.
    These crops should be tilled in to the ground at flowering stage. The most important green manure
    crops are Sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea), Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeate), Clusterbeans (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba), Pillipesara (Phaseolus trilobus) and
    Sesbania rostrata (stem nodulating). Soil organic matter can also be increased by incorporating green leaves and twigs
    collected from trees, shrubs and herbs grown elsewhere. This is called green leaf manuring. Some important species suitable for the
    purpose are Neem (Azadirachta indica), Mahua (Madhuca longifolia), Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), Karanji (Pongamia glabra), Calotropis (Calotropis gigantea), Avise (Sesbania grandiflora), Subabul
    (Leucaena leucocephala). In addition to enhancing soil fertility, green manuring and green leaf manuring also improves soil structure, increases 
    water holding capacity and reduces soil erosion. Growing green manure crops reduces weed proliferation and helps in reclamation of alkaline soils.
</p>

<p><em>Jeevamrutha</em></p>
<p>Method of preparation: (for 1 acre)</p>
<p>Water - 200 - 250 ltr.</p>
<p>Cow dung - 10 - 15 kg.</p>
<p>Cow urine - 3 - 4 ltr.</p>
<p>Jaggery - 1 - 2 kg.</p>
<p>Flour of pulses - 2 kg.</p>
<p>Soil - 2 - 3 handfuls</p>
<p>(Collect soil from the same field from under a tree or un-disturbed
location).</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Mix above mentioned ingredients and keep under shade for 3-4 days.</li>    
    <li>Stir the mixture once a day.</li>
    <li>Apply Jeevamrutha to plants when the soil is wet.</li>
    <li>Though it can be used even after 6-7 days, it is difficult because of its overpowering stench, hence it is advised to use Jeevamrutha within 3-4 days of preparation.</li>
</ul></p> 

<p><strong>PROBLEM SOILS</strong></p>

<p>Soils that cannot be economically used for crop production without adopting reclamation measures are called Problem Soils.</p>

<p><em>Acid soils</em></p>
<p>Acid soils have a pH of less than 6.5 and
respond to liming. They are common in humid regions.
Leaching of certain nutrients like Ca, Mg.
etc., enhances development of soil acidity.
Soils developed from acidic rocks like granite
containing Silica are naturally acidic.
Decomposition of organic matter in soil
increases acidity due to production of a large
number of organic and inorganic acids.
Application of fertilizers like Ammonium
Sulphate, Urea, Ammonium Nitrate also
contribute to acidity.
Increased concentrations of Aluminium,
Manganese and Iron in acid soils adversely
affect plant growth and yield.
Plants suffer from Calcium, Magnesium and
Potassium deficiency in acid soils.
Rock Phosphate is an economical and better
suited source of Phosphorus in acid soils.
Muriate of Potash (MOP), which also tends
to increase the pH is a better source of
Potassium than Potassium Sulphate.
A large number of beneficial microorganisms
become inactive in acid soils thus slowing
down mineralization and nitrification.
It has toxic effect on root tissues and
adversely affects the permeability. It affects the availability of Copper and Zinc
and Phosphorus also gets immobilized. Plant diseases are more prevalent in acidic
soils.
</p>

<p>Reclamation of acid soils:</p>
<p>
Acid soils can be reclaimed by adding metals
like Calcium and Magnesium, a process called liming.
The most common liming materials used are Lime stone [CaCO3], Quick lime [CaO]
and Slaked lime [Ca(OH)2], Dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2].Quantity of liming material depends on the
soil texture, with light soils requiring less than the heavy soils.
Requirement of liming material also depends on the pH and it may range from about 2
MT/acre for soils of pH 5.5 to as high as 4.8 MT/acre for soils of pH 3.5. 
Lime should be applied based on soil test reports because excessive liming leads to Fe,
Mn, Cu, Zn deficiency, decreased phosphate availability and Boron uptake. Lime should be applied at least one month
before cropping and mixed with soil by ploughing. Apply lime in small quantities every year or
once in two years. If the quantity is not more than 2 MT/acre, it can be applied in one dose.
</p>

<p><em>Dolomite</em></p>
<p>
    The most common liming materials used are Lime stone [CaCO3], Quick lime [CaO] and Slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]
    and Dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2]. Dolomite is Calcium Magnesium bicarbonate [(CaMg(CO3)2]. When Magnesium is to be provided to a crop along with correcting the soil acidity, Dolomite is the right choice.
    Unlike Gypsum, which is added routinely in irrigated soils, Dolomite is to be used for correcting soil acidity.
    At higher soil pH values, the carbonate in limestone and dolomite will actually burn the crops, and even cause
    plant death in severe cases.
</p>

<p><strong>
    NOTE: Lime should never be applied with nitrogenous fertilizers and water soluble phosphatic fertilizers 
    since it leads to loss of nitrogen in the form of Ammonia and decreases availability of Phosphorus.
</strong></p>

<p><em>Saline Soils</em></p>

<p>Saline soils contain high percentages of
chloride and sulphate of Calcium and
Magnesium.
The pH of the soils is less than 8.5 and
Electric Conductivity is >4 decisiemens/m.
The exchangeable Sodium is less than 15%
of Base Exchange capacity of soils.
The osmotic pressure due to high
concentrations of soluble salts decreases
water availability to plants, through exosmosis, resulting in stunted growth and
retarded growth of leaves and stems.
In extreme cases it leads to plasmolysis.
Seed germination is also reduced.
High concentrations of Sodium and Sulphate
reduce absorption of Calcium leading to Ca
deficiency.
Saline soils are formed when salts that
result from weathering are not fully leached
especially in arid and semi-arid areas; due to
upward movement of salts from lower depths
during seasonal irrigation; due to irrigating
with saline water or ingress of sea water.
</p>

<p><em>Reclamation of Saline soils:</em></p>

<p>There are three ways of reclamation of saline
soils – Eradication, Conversions and
Control. Eradication involves repeated heavy
flooding and draining of the soils to effectively
leach out the soluble salts.
The field should be made into smaller plots to
hold irrigation water and flooded with good
quality water up to 15-20 cm and puddled.
The water is then removed through drainage
channels. The process should be repeated
5-6 times. Leaching should be done before application
of Gypsum. Scraping of surface salts also can be done
as a method of eradication, but is not very
efficient and is costly. Conversion involves using Gypsum to
displace Sodium with Calcium from the
exchangeable complex. Gypsum should be applied in powder form uniformly in the field and mixed by light
ploughing of the upper 6 - 8 cm soil. Control method involves retardation of
evaporation by mulching, deep chiseling of
soil to open the impervious layer to improve
water percolation and addition of organic
matter.</p>

<p><em>Alkali Soils</em></p>

<p>Alakali soils are low in permeability of water
and air, sticky when wet, hard on drying,
and thus not congenial for plant growth.
High percentage of Sodium decreases
absorption of Calcium and Magnesium by
the roots.
Solubility of Zinc and Iron is affected.
It may even cause lime induced Iron chlorosis.
Plants show restricted root system and
delayed flowering.
Leaf burn is common due to excess of
chloride and sodium.
Alkali soils are of two kinds. Saline-alkali
soils and Non-saline alkali soils.</p>
<p>Saline-alkali soils:</p>
<p>These soils are both saline and alkaline
and contain appreciable quantities of
neutral soluble salts.
While pH remains &lt8.5 and EC >4
decisiemens/m as in saline soils, unlike
in saline soils the exchangeable Sodium
is more than 15% of base exchange
capacity of soils.</p>

<p>Non-saline alkali soils (Black alkali soils):</p>

<p>These soils do not contain large quantities of neutral soluble salts, but 
    exchangeable Sodium is more than 15% of base exchange capacity of soils. Soil pH is >8.5 and EC &lt4 decisiemens/m.
    High Sodium content results in dispersal of clay and organic matter leading to close packing of soil particles and
    reduces pore space and aeration. Soil develops shallow cracks and surface soil becomes hard and compact. Water does not percolate quickly and remains muddy for a long time.
    Application of alkaline fertilizers like Sodium Nitrate, basic slag etc., also contribute to alkalinity.
</p>

<p>Reclamation of Alkali soils:</p>
<p>Eradication: Leaching with excessive
flooding and draining is done as in
reclamation of saline soils after conversion
of exchangeable Sodium into water soluble
form.</p>

<p>Conversion:</p>
<p>Gypsum</p>
<p>	 Large quantities of Gypsum are applied
to replace Sodium and leach it downward
and out of reach of plant roots. Gypsum reacts with Sodium Carbonate
and adsorbed Sodium to produce Sodium
Sulphate, which dissolves in water and is
leached away. Dosage of Gypsum ranges from 800 kg/
acre in soils of pH 7.4 to 7.8 to as high
as 5.7 MT/acre for soils of pH above 9.0. Gypsum can be applied in one dose if the
requirement is below 3 MT/acre; in two
doses if it is between 3 and 5 MT and
three doses if it exceeds 5 MT. </p>

<p>Sulphur:</p>
<p>In extreme cases ground Sulphur is
incorporated into the soil several weeks
before planting of the crop.
In case of soils of pH 8.0, up to 2.50 MT
Sulphur and 5-7.5 MT of organic matter
per acre, is required to reduce the pH to
about 6.5.</p>
<p>Sulphuric acid:</p>
<p>Sulphuric acid may directly be used when
alkalinity is very high.
However, the method is expensive and
hazardous.</p>
<p>Lime or Lime sulphur: </p>
<p>Calcium Carbonate replacing Na+ in soil
colloid with Ca2+.</p>

<p>Ferrous Sulphate and soluble salts of
Aluminium: </p>
<p>These bring down alkalinity by formation
of Sulphuric acid resulting in production
of leachable Calcium Sulphate.</p>
<p>Mollases:</p>
<p>Mollases (2 MT/acre) and press mud (1
MT/acre) are also effective in reclamation
of alkali soils through production of
organic acid.</p>
<p>Organic manures: </p>
<p>Organic manures bring down the pH
through production of carbonic acid in
the soil, which solubilizes Calcium salts. Microbial activity in organic manure
also stimulates oxidation of Sulphur to
Sulphate form.</p>

<p>Mulching:</p>
<p>Mulching improves physical and microbial
properties, prevents crust formation,
disrupts capillary continuity, reduces
water loss through evaporation and
prevents accumulation of salts on soil
surface.</p>

<p>Fertilizer management in Saline and
Alkali soils</p>
<p>Fertilizers of acidic nature are advised for
alkali soils and Ammoniacal fertlizers are
useful in saline soils.
Due to decreased availability and leaching
of chemical fertilizers, generally 50% higher
dose of Nitrogen and Phosphorus are
recommended.
Application of Zinc Sulphate and Gypsum is
very essential in alkaline soils.
Organic manures have been observed to
be better than inorganic fertilizers in both
saline and alkali soils.
Dhaincha (Sesbania aculata) is an important
source of green manure in reclamation of
alkali soils.
Green manuring with Dhaincha along with
Gypsum is effective in restoring physical
condition and enriching the soil in nitrogen
and organic matter.</p>

<p>Gypsum - The versatile soil amendment</p>
<p>Gypsum is the most versatile soil amendment that has many uses especially in irrigated soils. 
    Gypsum being Calcium Sulphate (CaSO4.2H2O) is a key ingredient for maintenance of irrigated
    soils that would gradually turn saline or alkaline.
    Calcium in Gypsum replaces Sodium in sodic soils and helps in leaching it as Sodium Sulphate.
    In addition to preventing and correcting sodicity, Gypsum affords stability of soil organic
    matter, stable soil aggregates, improved water penetration and helps rapid seed emergence.
    It helps in breaking up compact soil, especially in combination with organic amendments.
    Gypsum rapidly decreases the pH of sodic soils.
    Gypsum improves the ability of soil to drain and not become waterlogged due to a combination
    of high sodium, swelling clay, and excess water.
    Gypsum provides Calcium, which is a major mechanism that binds soil organic matter to clay
    giving stability to soil aggregates.
    In combination with lime, it decreases leaching losses of Potassium and Magnesium.
    Gypsum increases water-use efficiency by improving water infiltration rates, hydraulic
    conductivity and better water storage in the soil leading to deeper rooting and better wateruse efficiency.
    It provides Calcium that is essential for the biochemical mechanisms by which most plants nutrients are absorbed by roots.
    Calcium in Gypsum regulates the balance of micronutrients, such as Iron, Zinc, Manganese
    and Copper, in plants. Calcium prevents excess uptake of many of them; and once they are in the plant, Calcium
    keeps them from having adverse effects when their levels get high.
    Application of Gypsum is essential for good fruit quality, especially in very high pH soils where adequate Calcium is not available.
    Gypsum helps prevent blossom-end rot of Watermelon and Tomatoes and bitter pit in Apples.
    Gypsum is preferred over lime for management of scab in Potatoes grown in acid soils.
    Root rot of Avocado trees caused by Phytophthora is partially corrected by Gypsum and organics.
    Gypsum decreases volatilization loss of Ammonium Nitrogen from applications of Ammonia, Ammonium Nitrate, Urea, Ammonium
    Sulfate, or any of the Ammonium Phosphates.</p>

<p><strong>SOIL TESTING</strong></p>
<p>Soil looses a considerable amount of its
nutrients due to uptake by plants, through
leaching and erosion. Continued maintenance of a high level of
soil fertility is indispensable for sustained agricultural production. From time to time the inherent fertility of
soil has to be evaluated. Soil test information along with knowledge
of specific crop requirements, cropping history and physical characteristics of the
soil help in determining the exact amounts of different nutrients and soil amendments,
if any, needed for a certain crop or cropping sequence. </p>

<p><em>Soil Sampling</em></p>
<p>Soil sample should be properly collected and be representative of the area to be tested.
    Avoid drawing samples from old bunds, marshy spots, hedges, areas previously occupied by compost heaps, etc.
    Do not sample in a field within three months
    of the application of lime, ash or fertilizer. 
    Where crops have been planted collect samples between plants and lines.
    To get representative samples, collect soil from at least 10 to 15 places randomly
    spread over the field. Scrape away the surface of the randomly
    selected points to remove weeds and litter. Dig pits of 6” x 6” or a ‘V’ shaped pit of 1
    ft. deep or collect samples of 0- 6”and 6-12” by scraping the sides of the pit.
    Make a composite sample by mixing samples from all pits thoroughly after breaking all lumps.
    Carry out successive quartering along with
    thorough mixing each time to prepare a final sample weighing about 500 gm. Dry samples in shade and pack them in
    clean cloth bags.
    Label each sample to provide the following information to help the chemist to 
    schedule accurate fertilizer / amendment recommendations.
    Farmer’s name and address. Cropping history. Crop intended to be grown.
    Details of standing crop, if any. Date of last ploughing.
    Quantity of lime, Gypsum and fertilizers applied and date of last application.
    Whether green manuring is practiced, if so when.</p>

<p><em>Soil Analysis</em></p>
<p>Soil samples are analyzed for the following
five soil properties.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Soil pH, which indicates whether the
soil is acidic, alkaline or normal.</li>
    <li>Total soluble salts, which indicates
whether the soil is saline or normal.</li>
    <li>Organic carbon, as measure of available
nitrogen.</li>
    <li>Available Phosphorus.</li>
    <li>Available Potash.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wherever facilities exist samples are also
analyzed for micro nutrients, especially for Zinc,
Iron, Boran, Manganese and Copper.</p>

<p><em>Soil test result interpretation</em></p>
<p>Soil test report usually has three main parts
apart from the farmer and soil sample details.
The first part indicates the actual test 
values in respect of pH, EC, OC, N, P, K,
S and wherever facilities are available it also
includes Zn, Fe, B, Mn and Cu.
The rating of the soil as Low, Medium
and High is also indicated against each
component. The second and third parts contain
recommendations on application of macro,
secondary and micronutrients along with
organic manure, biofertilizers and soil
amendment required, if any.
Conventionally, when the soils are classified
as ‘Medium’ in respect of the nutrient status,
it is recommended to apply fertilizers as per
the recommendations for the particular crop.</p>

<p><em>Food - The supreme medicine:</em></p>
<p>Just like human beings, plants also need balanced nutrition for higher performance.
    Balanced nutrition gives the plants general health and vigor.
    Vigorous plants are less prone to insect and disease attack.
    Plant protection begins with plant nutrition.
    Hence, Plant nutrition and Plant protection should go hand in hand.
    Man's health is dependent on Plant's health.
    Plant's health is dependent on Soil's health.
    Let us conserve soil and its health.</p>

<p><em>Root, Leaf &amp; Chlorophyll:</em></p>
<p>All crops are primarily plants.
    Only Plants have the ability to produce food
    on their own and provide food to rest of us
    directly or indirectly.
    Root, leaf and chlorophyll play major role in food production.</p>
    
<p><em>ROOTS:</em></p>
<p>Roots are not just leg of the plant, but also
mouth of the plant. They are the supplier of raw material like
water and minerals to the leaf.
Hence, larger the root system (deeper &amp;
wider) – quicker the absorption and supply
of raw materials to the leaves.
Deeper the root system more the drought
resistance to the plants.
Healthier the root – higher the efficiency of
the root activity.
Anything that can impair the root growth
can also impair its function.
Physical factors like soil texture, temperature,
moisture and physical damage can affect
root growth.
Chemical factors like soil pH can impair the
mineral absorption of the minerals.
Biological factors like soil-borne insects, 
nematodes, pathogenic bacteria and fungi
can cause disease and hence impair the
root’s functions.
Hence, it is important to ensure that the
roots are healthy and functional.</p>

<p><em>LEAVES:</em></p>

<p>Leaf is the kitchen of the plant where food
is prepared.
More the number of leaves and larger their
size, more kitchen space to cook food faster.
Anything that affects the leaf development
will affect their efficiency.
Damages due to foliar diseases caused by
viruses, bacteria, fungi and insects drastically
reduce their efficacy.
Physical factors like very low or high
temperatures, lack of sufficient water and
nutrition can lead to poor leaf development.
So help the plant to have more and larger
leaves for better productivity</p>

<p><em>CHLOROPHYLL:</em></p>
<p>Chlorophyll is the cook in the kitchen.
Only this green pigment of the plant has
the ability to use solar energy required for
photosynthesis.
Larger the number of chlorophyll content
per unit area, greener the leaves.
Greener the leaf, faster the food production
per unit time.
Many nutrients like Nitrogen, Magnesium,
Iron and Zinc are very essential elements for
chlorophyll production.
Through balanced nutrition help the plant to
grow big and greener for higher yields.</p>
