    <h3>Diseases</h3>
    <img src= {tomato}/>
    <h4>Symptoms and Signs</h4>
    <p>Symptoms are the manifestation of disease expressed as a result of pathogen activity in the host plant.
     In some cases, pathogens produce structures like mycelium, spores, sclerotia, pycnidia, etc., on the surface of the infected parts.
    These are called ‘Signs’, e.g., mildews, rusts, etc.
    There are mainly three types of morpho- logical symptoms.
Necrosis – Killing of plant tissues.
Hypertrophy and hyperplasia – Over-
development.
Hypotrophy and hypoplasia – Under development and stunting.
</p>

<h4>Necrosis</h4>
    <p>Necrosis means death of cells, tissues and organs due to pathogen activity.
Most destructive type and damage is irreversible.Almost all types of pathogens (fungi, bacteria, viruses, etc.) cause necrosis. Following are different kind of necrotic symptoms.</p>
<h4>Spots</h4>
<p>The most common necrotic symptoms that occur on leaves, floral parts and fruits.</p>
<p>They are well-defined localized areas of usually brown or tan necrotic tissue.</p>
<p>These spots may be surrounded by margins of purple or some other dark color.</p>
<p>Tiny spots are called ‘flecks’ or ‘specks’.</p>
<p>When dark threads of a fungal pathogen are seen on the spots, it is called ‘blotch’.</p>
<p>Sometimes fungal spots are raised and then they are called ‘tar spots’.</p>
<p>‘Shot hole’ spots are those where the dead and collapsed tissue shrink and fall off leaving a hole inside a spot.</p>
<p>In bacterial leaf spots they appear brown or water-soaked and usually remain localized</p>
  
<h4>Blight and Blast</h4>
<p>Initially, browning of infected plant parts  occurs and then extensive death happens in 
a rapid manner.</p>
<p>The dead tissues soon disintegrate and give burnt or scorched appearances.</p>
 <h4>Scorch</h4>
 <p>Scorch resembles blight, but the scorch occurs in irregular patterns usually
     along the margins of leaves, and, sometimes between the veins.
 </p>
 <h4>Scald</h4>
 <p>Scald is the blanching of epidermal and adjacent tissues of fruit and, occasionally, of leaves.</p>
<h4>Canker</h4>
<p>A ‘Canker’ is really a symptom of an injury often associated with
an open wound that has become infected by a fungal or bacterial pathogen.</p>
<p>Canker diseases frequently kill branches or structurally weaken a plant until the infected area breaks free, often during strong winds.</p>
<p>Citrus canker caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis is one of the more common diseases.</p>
<p>Infection causes lesions on the leaves, stems and fruit of citrus trees, including lime, oranges, and grapefruit.</p>

<h4>Die-back</h4>
<p>Severe necrosis of twigs or branches happens from the tip and advances downwards
Citrus canker caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis is one of the more common diseases.
towards the base is called ‘die-back’ or ‘stag head’.</p>
<p>The symptom often becomes apparent during the dormant season or shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Species of Colletotrichum (Chillies), Botryodiplodia (Mango), Phomopsis (Neem) and other fungi cause this symptom.</p>

<h4>Anthracnose</h4>
<p>This fungal disease affects many plants,
including vegetables, fruits and trees.</p>
<p>It causes dark, sunken lesions on leaves,
stems, flowers and fruits.</p>
<p>It also attacks developing shoots and
expanding leaves.</p>
<p>It can spread very quickly during rainy
seasons.</p>
<p>Anthracnose is a general term for a variety
of diseases that affect plants in similar ways.</p>
<p> On leaves, anthracnose generally appears
first as small, irregular yellow or brown spots.</p>
<p>These spots darken as they age and may also expand, covering the leaves.</p>
<p>On vegetables, it can affect any part of the
plant.</p>
<p>On fruits, it produces small, dark, sunken
spots, which may spread.</p>
<p>In moist weather, pinkish spore masses form
in the center of these spots.</p>
<p>Eventually, the fruits will rot.</p>
<p>On trees, it can kill the tips of young twigs.</p>
<p>It also attacks the young leaves, which
develop brown spots and patches.</p>
<p>It can also cause defoliation of the tree.</p>

<h4>Streak and Stripe</h4>
<p>Streak represents elongated necrotic area
along stems and leaf veins.</p>
<p>Stripe is also elongated necrotic area but
confined to leaf tissues between the veins,
particularly in monocots.</p>

<h4>Ring spots</h4>
<p>Ring spots are the common type of symptoms
produced by virus pathogens.</p>
<p>They are characterized by the appearance
of sometimes chlorotic but mostly necrotic
rings on the leaves or also on the fruits and
stems.</p>
<p>The ring spots may be present singly or in
groups developing concentrically on infected
parts.</p>
<p>Papaya ring spot, Tomato spotted wilt,
Tobacco ring spot, etc., are common
examples.</p>

<h4>Rots</h4>
<p>Rots represent dead and decomposed tissue
on various parts of the host plant as a result of
maceration and disintegration caused under
the influence of various enzymes secreted by
the pathogen.</p>
<p>Though the rotting may result due to nonparasitic causal agencies, the great majority
of rots are caused by fungal or bacterial
pathogens.</p>
<p>
All parts are prone to rots and they are
<ul>
<li> Root rot / Rhizome rot – in Ginger,
Turmeric, Chrysanthemum, etc.</li>
<li>Stem rot of Rice caused by Leptosphaeria
salvini.</li>
<li>Bud rot – Coconut, Arecanut caused by
Phytophthora palmivora.</li>
<li>Fruit rot - Most of the vegetables have
fungal fruit rots.</li>
<li>Ear and seed rot- Various fungi cause ear
rots in Maize.</li>
<li>Leaf rot - Black rot of crucifers
(Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris)</li>
<li>Tuber rot – Brown rot of Potato (Ralstonia
solanacearum).</li></ul>
</p>

<h4>Scabs</h4>
<p>Scabs are rough, crust-like localized lesions
usually slightly raised or sunken and cracked
giving a scabby appearance.</p>
<p>Though they can occur on every part of the
host but are frequently evident on fruits and
tubers</p>

<h4>Wilts</h4>
<p>Wilt is usually a generalized secondary
symptom where leaves and shoots lose their
turgidity, become flaccid and finally droop
(wilt).</p>
<p>Normally this happens due to blocking of
xylem vessels by the pathogen itself or by
substances secreted by it.</p>
<p>Wilts may be sudden without yellowing
(bacterial wilt of solanaceous crops) or
gradual, partial and slow wilt with yellowing
of leaves and finally total wilt as in the case
of Fusarium and Verticillium wilts.</p>
<p>Plants also wilt because of rotting of roots
and stems.</p>

<h4>Rust pustules</h4>
<p>These are the characteristic symptoms of
rust fungi.</p>
<p>All rust fungi are obligate pathogens.</p>
<p>Rust pustules are normally erumpent;
submerged, small or big in size.</p>
<p>Generally rust pustules are surrounded by
chlorotic halos.</p>
<p>Though they are common on leaves, they
can be found on stems also.</p>
<p>Normal colour of the pustules is red or yellow,
however, brown to dark colors are also not
uncommon in fungi belonging to
Basidiomycetes.</p>
<p> Pustules may be of whitish colour in white
rusts caused by Albugo candida under
Oomycetes.</p>
<p>And may be red in red rust caused by
Cephaleurus parasitica, a green alga</p>

<h4>Bleeding and Exudations</h4>
<p>Refers to the abnormal secretion or oozing
out of watery or slimy products from the
affected plant parts, which may or may not
set into hard masses.</p>
<p>It is the major symptom of some fungal diseases.</p>
<p>Citrus gummosis, Gummy stem blight in
Cucurbits and stem bleeding in Coconut and
Arecanut are some of the examples.</p>

<h4>Damping-off</h4>
<p>Sudden collapse of seedlings specially in
nursery bed or tray.</p>
<p> Fall over of the seedlings due to weakening of
the base of the stem.</p>
<p>Species of Pythium and Rhizoctonia are the
common fungi that cause this.</p>
<p> Excess moisture or dampness causes this
disease.</p>

<h4>Mildews</h4>
<p>Mildews represent the chlorotic or necrotic
areas generally covered with sporulation of
the fungal pathogen.</p>
<p>There are two types of mildews namely
‘Downy’ and ‘Powdery’.</p>

<h5>Downey Mildews</h5>
<p>Downy mildews are caused by a group of
Oomycetous ‘fungal’ pathogens belonging to
family Peronosporaceae.</p>
<p>Downy mildews occur on both monocots
and dicots.</p>
<p>Upper surface of the leaf show chlorotic
spots (pale yellow/purplish / yellowish, etc.)
of varying size and form which later merge
into surrounding green tissues.</p>
<p>The corresponding lower surface is covered with white cottony or downy growth, hence
the name ‘Downy Mildew’.</p>
<p>However, under severe disease condition, the
cottony growth and sporulation can happen
on upper surface also.</p>
<p>In some cases the infection will occur on
floral parts and even on fruits.</p>
<p>In cereal Downy Mildews, phyllody of the
inflorescence (green ear) is also caused.</p>

<h5>Powdery Mildews</h5>
<p>Powdery mildews are caused by fungi
belonging to Ascomycetes and family
Erysiphaceae.</p>
<p>These are also obligate pathogens like Rust
fungi.</p>
<p>Powdery mildew is the most common disease
occuring on a very large range of crops.</p>
<p>The symptoms are typical and very easy to
recognize owing to its powdery appearance.</p>
<p>They produce chlorotic or necrotic areas
covered superficially growing mycelia and
fructifications of the pathogen.</p>
<p>Black minute fruiting bodies are also visible
at the end of the season.</p>

<h4>Hyperplasia and Hypertrophy (Over Development)</h4>
<p>Many pathogens, through their biochemical
activity induce hormonal imbalance.</p>
<p>This results in excessive growth of host
tissues and causes abnormal increase in size
of affected organs.</p>
<p>It is brought about by one or both of the
two processes known as hyperplasia and
hypertrophy. </p>
<p>Hyperplasia is the abnormal increase in the
size of plant organs due to increase in number
of cells by increased cell division rate.</p>
<p>In hypertrophy the increased size of the
organ is due to increase in the size of cells of
a particular tissue.</p>

<h4>Galls</h4>
<p>Galls are localized enlargements on various
plant parts in the form of small pustules or
warts, larger tubercles, tumours or
masses of cells making a morbid outgrowth
of either fleshy or woody texture, in which
host tissues and pathogens unite.</p>
<p>Knots may be fleshy or woody in their
texture.</p>
<p>Nematode like Meloidogyne incognita, fungi
like Protomyces macrosporus, bacteria like
Agrobacterium tumefaciens are some of the
common examples.</p>

<h4>Warts</h4>
<p>Warts are protuberances developed on
tubers and stems generally giving warty or
discolored Cauliflower-like appearance.</p>
<p>Good example is wart disease of Potato
caused by Synchytrium endobioticum. </p>

<h4>Leaf Curl</h4>
<p>These symptoms represent irregular and
extensive wrinkling and furrowing of leaves
due to reduced growth of veins in comparison
with the growth of laminar tissue resulting
in sunken veins and raised up laminar tissue
leading to the curling of the leaves.</p>
<p>Papaya, Tomato, Cotton, Tobacco, Chilli
crops are most susceptible to leaf curl by
whitefly transmitted viruses.</p>

<h4>Hypotrophy and Hypoplasia</h4>
<p>In some diseases, infected cells and tissues
slowdown in development resulting in the
infected plant parts thereof being arrested
in their growth as a result of degeneration
of the cells (hypotrophy) or subnormal cell
divisions (hypoplasia).</p>
<p>Though some of the fungal and bacterial
diseases exhibit these symptoms, viruses
produce more of these symptoms.</p>

<h4>Chlorosis</h4>
<p>Destruction of or inhibition of chlorophyll
formation is called chlorosis.</p>
<p>The leaves with less chlorophyll appear pale
green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Extreme case of chlorosis is ‘blanching’ or
‘bleaching’</p>
<p>Chlorosis is commonly caused by viruses.</p>
<p> However, certain nutrient deficiencies also
cause chlorosis.</p>
<p>Variety of chlorotic symptoms are caused by
viruses viz., mosaic, mottle, vein-chlorosis,
vein-clearing, vein-banding, etc.</p>

<h4>Mosaicing</h4>
<p>Irregular intermingling of normal green with
light green, yellow or white chlorotic areas
imparting a mosaic-like pattern.</p>
<p>Tomato mosaic, Tobacco mosaic, Pumpkin
mosaic, Yellow vein mosaic of Okra, etc.</p>

<h4>Leaf narrowing</h4>
<p>The infected leaves generally become narrow
due to reduced growth of laminar tissue,
but the veins and midrib remain normal in
growth.</p>
<p>In extreme cases only the main veins remain
normal while laminar tissue is almost
completely absent, e.g. rat tail symptom in
Tomato (CMV), Papaya (PRSV), etc.</p>

<h4>Stunting or dwarfing</h4>
<p>Refers to the reduction in size of either the
whole plant or a specific plant part.</p>
<p>It results in reduced size and loss of vigour.</p>
<p>Stunting may be caused by viral, bacterial,
fungal or nematode infections.</p>
<p>Insect or mite feeding can also cause stuntingor dwarfing.</p>
<p>Even abiotic factors like lack of water,
imbalance of soil nutrients, excess light,
chemical or mechanical injuries can cause
stunting.</p>
<p>Stunting due to abiotic factors can easily be
corrected. </p>

<h4>Rosetting</h4>
<p>Rosetting means shortening of internodes of
the infected plant along with the clumping of the foliage together at the apices of branches.</p>

<h4>Fasciation</h4>
<p>Fasciation also known as cresting, is a
relatively rare condition of abnormal growth
in vascular plants.</p>
<p>Here the apical meristem (growing tip),
which normally is concentrated around a
single point and produces approximately
cylindrical tissue, instead becomes elongated
perpendicularly to the direction of growth,
thus, producing flattened, ribbon-like, crested
(cristate), or elaborately contorted tissue.</p>
<p>Fasciation may also cause plant parts to increase in weight and volume in some
instances.</p>
<p>The phenomenon may occur in the stem,
root, fruit or flower head.</p>
<p> Some plants are grown and prized
aesthetically for their development of
fasciation.</p>
<p> Any occurrence of fasciation has several
possible causes, including hormonal, genetic,
bacterial, fungal, viral and environmental
causes.</p>

<h4>Transformation or Replacement of Plant Organs</h4>
<p>Normal plant organs particularly floral organs
are replaced by a structure of the pathogen,
causing severe yield losses.</p>
<p>In case of smut, the ovary is transformed into
structure containing smut spores.</p>
<p>In ergot disease, the ovary is invaded by the
fungus and transforms it into scelotial body.</p>
<p>In Udbatta disease of Rice, which is also
called false ergot, the seeds become pseudosclerotia.</p>

<h5>Little leaf disease</h5>
<p>This is a serious mycoplasma disease of
Brinjal.</p>
<p>The disease is transmitted by leaf hoppers
(Cestius (Hishimonus) phycitis and Amrasca
biguttula).</p>
<p>The leaves of the infected plants in the early
stages are light yellow in colour, reduced in
size and are malformed.</p>
<p>Disease affected plants are generally shorter
in stature bearing a large number of branches,
and leaves much much smaller than healthy
plants. </p>
<p>The petioles get shorter considerably,
many buds appear in the axil of leaves
and internodes get shortened thus giving
the plants a bushy appearance (rosetting/
witches broom symptoms).</p>
<p> Flower parts are deformed leading the plants
to be sterile.</p>
<p>Infected plants do not bear any fruit.</p>
<p>However, if any fruit is formed it becomes
hard and tough and fails to mature.</p>
<p>Recently this disease is also affecting Beans
crop</p>

<h5>Smuts</h5>
<p>Smuts refer to sooty or charcoal-like powdery
mass usually appearing on floral organs,
particularly the ovary.</p>
<p>However, they can occur on leaf, stem and
roots.</p>
<p>They are caused by Basidiomycetes belonging
to order Ustilaginales.</p>
<p>Smut infected tissues are either destroyed or
replaced by black smut spores or they are first
stimulated to divide and enlarge to produce
a swelling or gall of varying size and then
destroyed and replaced by smut spores.</p>
<p>Corn, Sorghum, Wheat and Rice are the
common smut hosts.</p>

<h5>Ergots</h5>
<p>The ergot causing fungus infects the florets
and develops in the ovaries, producing initially
copious creamy, pink, or red colored sweet
sticky liquid called honeydew.</p>
<p>The honeydew can drip down onto the
upper leaves making them sticky.</p>
<p>Often pollen and anther sacs adhere to the
honeydew.</p>
<p>Subsequently, long dark colored hard
structures, sclerotia, develop from infected
florets, first dark at the tip and then
completely black.</p>
<p>Udbatta disease or incense rod disease is
also called ‘False Ergot of Rice’ as it is not
Ergot in real sense.</p>

<h5>Transformation of floral organs</h5>
<p>Floral organs are transformed into leafy
structures.</p>
<p>Phyllody refers to the development of floral
parts into leafy structures, generally caused
by virus or Phytoplasma infection such as
aster yellows.</p>
<p>However, in case of Downy Mildew of Finger
millet, Pearl millet and Maize (male tassel) the
inflorescence can show phyllody.</p>
<p>Phyllody causes the affected plant to become
partially or entirely sterile.</p>
